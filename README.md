We are using the phylogenetic tree of https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982221001391
As for 26th of July 2023, we have functional data in 5 categories based on the network analysis for 967 species in the tree (out of 1672 species in the tree in total)
I will keep adding trait data for the remainin species.
