Absidia species are characterized by the formation of relatively small, apophysate sporangia (Fig 1) with deliquescent walls, a single septum is formed in the subtending sporangiophore, and the production of stolons and rhizoids; the sporangiophore is never formed opposite the rhizoids (as in Rhizopus). Zygospores are formed on opposed, more or less equal suspensors adorned with several appendages (Fig 2). One species, Absidia coerulea Bainier has been used in industry for biotransformation and chitosan production, and (Nwe 2008). Some former members of this genus are pathogenic (e.g. A. corymbifera) causing mucoromycoses in humans and cows but these taxa are now in the genus Lichtheimia Vuill. Sequencing of A. repens will advance the 1000 Fungal Genome Project by providing a representative genome for Cunninghamellaceae, an important family of “zygomycetes” and additional insight into this early branching group of fungi. ; References: ; Hesseltine, C.W., and J.

As there is no report of Acaromyces species causing damage to plants, they may serve as promising biological agents for integrated pest management.   The strain of A. ingoldii used for genome sequencing was isolated from a leaf phylloplane in Scotland. The fungus forms discrete white, velvety to pruinose colonies on potato dextrose agar (PDA). Microscopically, it is composed of hyaline septate hyphae with blastoconidia formed in acropetal chains. Acaromyces is a monotypic yeast-like genus that is morphologically similar to the anamorphic “smut” (subphylum Ustilaginomycotina) fungus genus Pseudozyma, and in its mite-associated habit with another anamorphic smut genus, Meira. However, while phylogenetic analyses of several nuclear rDNA loci support the placement of Acaromyces within the Exobasidiales (Exobasidiomycetes, Ustilaginomycotina), it is not a close relative of either Pseudozyma or Meira species, but rather belongs to Cryptobasidiaceae (Boekhout et al., 2003, Rush and Aime, 2013). Whether A. ingoldii possess a sexual state remains unknown (Boekhout et al. 2003). The genome sequence of A. ingoldii will provide the first whole genome reference sequence for a member of Cryptobasidiaceae. Researchers will use these data in phylogenetic and phylogenomic reconstructions and in comparative genomics studies that seek to elucidate the molecular bases governing production of sexual and anamorphic states, invertebrate toxins, and the evolution of phytopathogenicity in Ustilaginomycotina. ;  ; References: Boekhout T, Theelen B, Houbraken J, Robert V, Scorozetti G, Gafni A, Gerson U, Sztejnberg A. 2003.

As chytrids develop (in most cases uni-) flagellated zoospores (resembling flagellated cells in animals) at various stages of their life cycle, they are also known as zoosporic fungi. Because the Chytridiomycota are not monophyletic in some phylogenetic analyses (although currently without compelling statistical support), they have been subdivided into three phyla: Blastocladiomycota, Chytridiomycota, and Neocallimastigomycota. ; Allomyces macrogynus is found worldwide, particularly in aquatic environments of tropical regions. It alternates between isomorphic sporophytic sexual and gametophytic asexual cycles of growth, producing three forms of uniflagellated cells: mitospores (zoospores), meiospores, and male and female gametes. When encysting, these flagellated cells withdraw their flagellum. Bipolar spore germination then leads to the development of a rhizoidal system, and a thallus that branches into hyphae that are separated by pseudoseptae (i.e., they are not closed but contain pores).

As chytrids develop (in most cases uni-) flagellated zoospores (resembling flagellated cells in animals) at various stages of their life cycle, they are also known as zoosporic fungi. Because the Chytridiomycota are not monophyletic in some phylogenetic analyses (although currently without compelling statistical support), they have been subdivided into three phyla: Blastocladiomycota, Chytridiomycota, and Neocallimastigomycota. ; Allomyces macrogynus is found worldwide, particularly in aquatic environments of tropical regions. It alternates between isomorphic sporophytic sexual and gametophytic asexual cycles of growth, producing three forms of uniflagellated cells: mitospores (zoospores), meiospores, and male and female gametes. When encysting, these flagellated cells withdraw their flagellum. Bipolar spore germination then leads to the development of a rhizoidal system, and a thallus that branches into hyphae that are separated by pseudoseptae (i.e., they are not closed but contain pores). The wild-type strain Burma 3-35 (ATCC 38327) is autotetraploid in the sporophytic cycle, and produces diploid gametophytes.

Alternaria alternata is a ubiquitous, saprophytic fungus that has been isolated from various dead plant materials. The fungus is also a weak pathogen causing indefinite or opportunistic disease on a number of crops. The fungus produces host-selective toxins with a diverse range of structures that function as effectors controlling pathogenicity or virulence. The secretion of host-selective toxins by A. alternata leads to diverse fungal diseases on specific plants. Several A. alternata isolates have been isolated from the roots of healthy plants, suggesting they can also live benignly as endophyte within plant tissues. The sequenced Alternaria alternata MPI-PUGE-AT-0064 has been isolated from healthy Arabidopsis thaliana plants grown in natural soil after surface sterilization of plant roots. The sequencing of this fungal isolate is part of a larger project aiming at sequencing the genomes of numerous phylogenetically diverse root-associated fungi from Arabidopsis, Populus, and other plant hosts for further comparative genome analysis. Unravelling the genomic signatures reflecting the adaptation of these microbes to the host cell environment represent a promising way to better understand how the endophytic lifestyle evolved in phylogenetically unrelated fungal species. Comparative genome analysis between saprotrophic, mycorrhizal, and pathogenic fungi will provide new insights into the specific adaptations but also the conserved signatures associated with these different fungal lifestyles. ; Researchers who wish to publish analyses using data from unpublished CSP genomes are respectfully required to contact the PI and JGI to avoid potential conflicts on data use and coordinate other publications with the CSP master paper(s). ;  ",,,,Alternaria alternata_39.64444444_17.25555556

Alternaria are critically important in ecosystem functioning where they are primary degraders of carbon, control CO2 fluxes from soils, and form both synergistic and antagonistic (pathogenic) relationships with microbes, plants, and animals.    Alternaria alternata is one of the most common species and is ubiquitous in nature.  This species has been recovered from a range of environments including soil, freshwater, seawater, plants, indoor air, and humans.  Some Alternaria alternata strains also have a demonstrated ability to produce a wide range of mycotoxins (e.g., altenuene, alternariol, and tentoxin) that play an important role in the pathogenicity of this organism.  Indeed, Alternaria alternata has been implicated as a plant pathogen in a variety of food crops, such as brown rot of tangerines, leaf spot of lemons and limes, and black rot of a variety of fruits and vegetables. In humans, this species is an opportuntistic pathogen and has been linked directly to allergenic and asthmatic reactions.  Numerous A. alternaria strains live a saprotrophic lifestyle, living off of dead and decaying organic matter.  The degradation of recalcitrant carbon compounds (including humics, lignin, cellulose) is accomplished largely by the extracellular production of enzymes and reactive small molecules such as reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxalate. Additionally, Mn(III) compounds and Mn(III/IV) oxide minerals (highly reactive oxidants) produced by this species further promotes carbon degradation as well as the biogeochemical cycling of metals in the environment. Production of reactive metabolites and oxidants is linked in part to secreted proteins, cell differentiation, nutrient composition, and species interactions, although the molecular mechanisms are not fully resolved. Genome sequencing in concert with transcriptome and secretome analysis of this and related Ascomycete fungal species that promote lignocellulose degradation and Mn(II) oxidation will improve our understanding of the growth-specific production and total production potential of reactive metabolites and oxidants by Alternaria alternata.  Ultimately, these results will improve model predictions of carbon degradation and CO2 emissions in a changing biogeochemical landscape as well as provide plausible approaches to increase carbon sequestration, metal bioremediation, and pathogen resistance.",,,,Alternaria alternata_39.64444444_17.25555556

Alternaria spores can be typically found in the air, soil, decaying plant material, wood, and foods. Alternaria brassicicola (Schweinitz, Wiltshire) is a ubiquitous plant pathogenic fungus but also exists as a saprophyte. ; Alternaria brassicicola causes black spot disease (also called dark leaf spot) on virtually every important cultivated Brassica species including broccoli, cabbage, canola, and mustard. It is of worldwide economic importance resulting occasionally in 20-50% yield reductions in crops such as canola, mustard or rape. Like other diseases caused by Alternaria species, black spot appears on the leaves as necrotic lesions, which are often described as black and sooty with chlorotic yellow halos surrounding the lesion sites. Alternaria brassicicola, however, is not limited to infection of leaves, and can infect all parts of the plant including pods, seeds, and stems, and is of particular importance as a post-harvest disease. Alternaria brassicicola is considered a necrotrophic (causing death) plant pathogenic fungus and like other Alternaria species has been shown to secrete numerous toxic secondary metabolites and proteins that cause cell death via induction of apoptosis in plants or by directly damaging cells. Alternaria brassicicola has routinely been used as a model necrotrophic fungal pathogen in studies with Arabidopsis thaliana, also a weedy member of the Brassicaceae plant family. From a human health perspective, Alternaria brassicicola is representative of a genus of fungi that is considered one of the most potent sources of mold-derived allergens.

Estimates of the number of species range from approximately 100 to several hundred, although specific data are difficult to assess due to the proliferation of nomenclatural synonyms of dubious taxonomic validity. Many species are common saprobes found in a variety of habitats and are ubiquitous agents of decay. Citations from literature report recovery from such diverse substrates as sewage, leather, marine organisms, plants, wood pulp, paper, textiles, building supplies, stone monuments, optical instruments, cosmetics, computer disks, and jet fuel. As plant pathogens, thousands of Alternaria/host associations are recorded in the USDA Fungal Host Index. As decomposers of foodstuffs, Alternaria species are ubiquitous postharvest pathogens and contribute to the spoilage of much of our agricultural output. In contrast, several Alternaria species have shown promise as beneficial biocontrol agents of certain weed pests and as mycoparasites of other fungal pathogens. ; In medical mycology, Alternaria species are gaining prominence as emerging human pathogens, particularly in immune-compromised patients. Several Alternaria species and numerous uncharacterized Alternaria taxa have been found associated with infections of the cornea, oral and sinus cavities, respiratory tract, nails, and skin. Perhaps more importantly, Alternaria spores, especially from A. alternata, are one of the most common and potent sources of indoor and outdoor airborne allergens. Additionally, Alternaria sensitization has been determined to be one of the most important factors in the onset and exacerbation of childhood and fatal asthma. There may also be a clinical association with another allergic disease of the sinus, chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). Alternaria species are some of the most prodigious producers of toxic secondary metabolites, producing over 70 compounds of varying toxicity. Some of these metabolites are powerful mycotoxins with mutagenic and teratogenic properties, and have been linked to certain forms of cancer. The occurrence of Alternaria secondary metabolites in foodstuffs such as grains, peanuts, tomato products, apple sauce, olive oil, and fresh fruits and vegetables is becoming an increasing environmental concern.

This ascomycete fungus is also known as Cladosporium resinae or Amorphotheca resinae, the latter is the name for the perfect or sexual state of the fungus (Seifert, Hughes et al. 2007). It has been known since the 1960’s that Hormoconis resinae is a common and problematic contaminant of jet fuel (Hendey 1964). Subsequent investigations revealed that it could catabolize hydrocarbons (Walker and Cooney 1971). Furthermore, it can also produce a variety of hydrocarbons when grown on glucose, glutamate or fatty acids (Walker and Cooney 1973). When H. resinae was cultured on glucose, 98% of the hydrocarbon was pristane (C19H40) or hexadecane (Walker and Cooney 1973). With the current interest in biofuels, and especially infrastructure compatible hydrocarbon biofuels, there has been renewed interest in organisms like H. resinae. In addition, given the hydrocarbon rich environment from which H. resinae has most often been cultured, its complement of biomass degrading enzymes may have interesting properties. This aspect of the physiology of H. resinae has not been studied in detail, though one glycoside hydrolase has been isolated (Tsunoda, Sakano et al. 1978). The availability of a genome sequence for this interesting and potentially valuable fungus will facilitate studies of hydrocarbon production, biomass hydrolysis and the biology of fungal growth in environments dominated by hydrophobic carbon sources. ; Hendey, N.

S4 is an isolated strain of anaerobic gut fungi from the order Neocallimastigales. The organisms in this order are the earliest diverging branch of free-living fungi.  They are obligate anaerobes and contain hydrogenosomes for energy generation and lack mitochondria. They reproduce asexually through the production of flagellated zoospores, following a life cycle that resembles that of the members of the Chytridiomycota phylum. Anaerobic gut fungi can be found in the guts of herbivores that consume primarily grassy diets, such as ruminants and hindgut fermenters. Within these animals, they are part of a microbial community that colonizes and degrades plant material. Gut fungi can be isolated from the feces of these animals and are capable of degrading biomass without pretreatment in isolated cultures (Haitjema et al., 2014). Due to this biomass degrading capability, they are of interest for renewable biotechnology applications.Anaeromyces sp. S4 was isolated from the fecal material of a sheep at the Santa Barbara Zoo. The organism is a polycentric fungus with multinucleate rhizomycelia bearing multiple sporangia. This fungal isolate is of interest for both evolutionary and biotechnology studies. Transcriptomic and genomic analyses will aid in the discovery of novel biomass degrading enzymes that may be used for production of fuels or chemicals from lignocellulosic sources. Further understanding through additional –OMICS based characterization will also aid in the understanding and application of these organisms and their enzymes.References  Haitjema CH, Solomon KV, Henske JK, Theodorou MK, O’Malley MA. 2014.

Please note that this copy of the genome is not maintained by the author and is therefore not automatically updated. ; Members of the phylum Microsporidia are highly successful, obligate intracellular eukaryotic parasites with remarkably small genomes of 2.3-20 megabases (MB). They infect nearly all the invertebrate phyla, most commonly arthropods, and all five classes of vertebrates. In agricultural settings, some microsporidial species serve as biological control agents of pests, including Antonospora locustae (Nolo Bait) while others are significant pathogens of beneficial insects. A survey of genomic sequences from Antonospora locustae, a microsporidian that is distantly related to E. cuniculi, suggested that this compaction has further effects on the evolution of microsporidian genomes. Specifically, this survey showed that the order of genes in the A. locustae and E. cuniculi genomes share a high degree of conservation, and that this conservation was correlated with short intergenic spaces. Conservation of gene order usually degrades rapidly in eukaryotic genomes leading to the suggestion that genome compaction could slow the rate of genome rearrangements. This comparison also challenged the hypothesis that the rate of genome evolution may be correlated with the rate of sequence evolution since the rate of sequence evolution between the two species is relatively high. ;   ; Citation ;  ",,,,Antonospora locustae_4.5_2.5

This species is a successor species of Fomitopsis pinicola, meaning that it only inhabits trunks occupied by another polypore species, F. pinicola (Niemelä et al. 1995). A. citrinella, itself a white-rotter, is able to outcompete F. pinicola, a brown-rotter, when mycelia of the two species are faced against each other (Holmer et al. 1997). A. citrinella has evidently specialized to target F. pinicola to the degree that it is not found in nature without its predecessor.  Although F. pinicola is one of the most common wood decay fungi in Northern Europe, A. citrinella is much rarer, found in areas with abundant, Fomitopsis-colonized dead wood only, usually in old-growth forests (Ryvarden & Melo 2016). The species is red-listed in several European countries.A. citrinella belongs to the family Steccherinaceae in the order Polyporales. It is the second species from this family with its genome sequenced along with Albatrellus peckianus. The genome will help to resolve phylogeny of the Polyporales, and the ""residual polyporoid clade"" in particular. It will also serve as a reference genome in population genomic studies of the species and provide another reference white-rot genome for functional studies on wood decomposition.

This species is a successor species of Fomitopsis pinicola, meaning that it only inhabits trunks occupied by another polypore species, F. pinicola (Niemelä et al. 1995). A. citrinella, itself a white-rotter, is able to outcompete F. pinicola, a brown-rotter, when mycelia of the two species are faced against each other (Holmer et al. 1997). A. citrinella has evidently specialized to target F. pinicola to the degree that it is not found in nature without its predecessor.  Although F. pinicola is one of the most common wood decay fungi in Northern Europe, A. citrinella is much rarer, found in areas with abundant, Fomitopsis-colonized dead wood only, usually in old-growth forests (Ryvarden & Melo 2016). The species is red-listed in several European countries.A. citrinella belongs to the family Steccherinaceae in the order Polyporales. It is the second species from this family with its genome sequenced along with Albatrellus peckianus. The genome will help to resolve phylogeny of the Polyporales, and the ""residual polyporoid clade"" in particular. It will also serve as a reference genome in population genomic studies of the species and provide another reference white-rot genome for functional studies on wood decomposition.

It includes one of the largest terrestrial organisms on Earth, known as the humongous fungus, that was discovered in Malheur National Forest (Oregon). Its continuous colony covers 3.4 square miles. Recent phylogenetic analyses have revealed the existence of two allopatric species within the A. ostoyae complex. A. ostoyae is restricted to European/Eurasian forests, whereas in North America the species should be named A. solidipes. The genome of both species have been sequenced and show substantial differences, undepinning their separation. The diploid individuals of A. ostoyae, spreading very effciently by shoestring like mycelial structures, rhizomorphs, often form large colonies in the soil and have access to the roots of potential hosts in extended areas. A. ostoyae is a facultative necrotroph with isolates exhibiting a significant diversity in virulence.

These fungi are capable of developing specific trapping devices such as adhesive networks, adhesive knobs, and constricting rings to capture nematodes and then extract nutrients from their nematode prey. Most nematode-trapping fungi can live as both saprophytes and parasites. They play important roles in maintaining nematode population density in diverse natural environments. Their broad adaptability and flexible lifestyles also make them ideal agents for controlling parasitic nematodes of plants and animals. ; Arthrobotrys oligospora (teleomorph Orbilia auricolor) is one of the best-studied nematode-trapping fungi. Strains of A. oligospora have been found in diverse soil environments including heavy metal-polluted soils and decaying wood where they live mainly as saprophytes. In the presence of nematodes, A. oligospora enters the parasitic stage by forming complex three-dimensional networks to trap nematodes. The trapping initiates a series of processes including adhesion, penetration, and immobilization of nematodes. The ability to trap nematodes makes it an attractive candidate agent for controlling parasitic nematodes of plants and animals. Indeed, two commercial biological nematicides, Royal 300 and Royal 350, have been developed based on two species closely related to A. oligospora: A. robusta and A. irregularis. ;   ;   ; ",,,,Arthrobotrys oligospora_26.67647059_15.16176471

It was observed to produce VOCs, notably 8-annulene, that inhibited the growth of a variety of test fungi and oomycetes. In 2008 its VOC profile was revisited and a different suite of molecules were observed, including a series of gasoline-like branched and straight-chain alkanes, alkenes and alcohols. In addition, many of these molecules were observed when the fungus was grown on a medium containing cellulose as the sole carbon source, leading to the speculation that this organism could be used to convert waste biomass to fuel (Strobel et al., 2008).

The discovery of regulatory domains in the non-coding regions of important carbon flux genes will help to identify and characterize the ""circuits"" involved in carbon cycling. Furthermore, Aspergillus species are important models for the study of eukaryotic protein secretion, the effects of various environmental factors on suppressing or triggering the export of diverse biomass degrading enzymes, molecular mechanisms critical to fermentation process development, and mechanisms involved in the control of fungal morphology. Aspergillus aculeatus is a ubiquitous species that is commonly isolated from soil and rotting fruit.  Like other black-spored Aspergillus species, morphological criteria like color, shape, size, and ornamentation of conidia have been used to classify strains.  However, the black aspergilli vary significantly in their morphological and physiological characteristics, and unambiguous identification of an isolate requires molecular and biochemical identification techniques.  Owing to its ability to rapidly degrade plant cell walls, A. aculeatus isolates have been used to produce a number of important industrial enzymes (cellulases, hemicellulases, proteases) that are used commercially in the food and feed industries. The biochemical and catalytic properties of several extracellular glycosyl hydrolases from A. aculeatus have been studied in detail. In addition, several A. aculeatus polysaccharide degrading enzymes have studied at the structural level by X-ray crystallography. ",,,,Aspergillus aculeatus_6.607142857_6.464285714

All black aspergilli grow well on wheat bran, a crude plant biomass, but their protein (SDS-PAGE) and enzyme activity profiles are significantly different between these species. This indicates that they apply different strategies to degrade plant biomass and detailed analysis of these differences will enable us to design better industrial processes that involve plant biomass degradation.

A densely sporulating strain with short conidiophores, N402 (cspA1), was isolated following two rounds of low-dosed UV mutagenesis of about 75% survival each (personal communication, Fons Debets of the University of Wageningen). Strain N402 (ATCC 64974, FGSC A733) was used by Bos and his colleagues as a starting strain for genetic studies.  Low doses of UV irradiation were used to generate morphological and nutritional mutants. These initial efforts have mapped over 80 markers to eight linkage groups  [3, 4]  . The Fungal Genetics Stock Center (www.fgsc.net) maintains over 300 genetically marked strains derived from N402.

Among these strains, N593 (ATCC 64973, FGSC EK31), which carries a mutation in the orotidine-5'-phosphate-decarboxylase (pyrG) gene, is often used for studies that involve genetic transformation. This is because pyrG can be used as a bidirectional dominant marker, either presence or absence of the marker can be selected  [5]. ; The NRRL3 genome has been assembled to eight telomere-to-telomere chromosomes, with seven gaps corresponding to seven of the eight centromeres. Importantly, the gene models have been curated manually based on evidence from: de novo assembled transcripts, strand-specific RNA-seq coverage, distribution and orientation of predicted introns, peptide sequences determined by mass spectrometry, H3K4me3 ChIP-seq peaks, protein domains, and similarity to orthologues.  This manually curated genome should provide a valuable reference for genetic manipulations and genome-wide studies of A. niger. ;   ; 1.                  Pel HJ, de Winde JH, Archer DB, Dyer PS, Hofmann G, Schaap PJ, Turner G, de Vries RP, Albang R, Albermann K et al: Genome sequencing and analysis of the versatile cell factory Aspergillus niger CBS 513.88. Nature biotechnology 2007, 25(2):221-231. ; 2.                  Andersen MR, Salazar MP, Schaap PJ, van de Vondervoort PJ, Culley D, Thykaer J, Frisvad JC, Nielsen KF, Albang R, Albermann K et al: Comparative genomics of citric-acid-producing Aspergillus niger ATCC 1015 versus enzyme-producing CBS 513.88. Genome research 2011, 21(6):885-897. ; 3.                  Bos CJ, Debets AJ, Swart K, Huybers A, Kobus G, Slakhorst SM: Genetic analysis and the construction of master strains for assignment of genes to six linkage groups in Aspergillus niger. Current genetics 1988,14(5):437-443. ; 4.                  Debets F, Swart K, Hoekstra RF, Bos CJ: Genetic maps of eight linkage groups of Aspergillus niger based on mitotic mapping. Current genetics 1993, 23(1):47-53. ; 5.                  Goosen T, Bloemheuvel G, Christoph G, de Bie DA, Henk WJ, van den B, Klaas S: Transformation of Aspergillus niger using the homologous orotidine-5""-phosphate-decarboxylase gene Current genetics 1987,11:499-503. ; Aguilar-Pontes MV, Brandl J, McDonnell E, Strasser K, Nguyen TTM, Riley R, Salamov A, Nybo JL, Vesth TC, Grigoriev IV, Andersen MR, Tsang A, de Vries RP (2018) The gold-standard genome of Aspergillus niger NRRL 3 enables a detailed view of the diversity of sugar catabolism in fungi. Studies in Mycology, in press",,,,Aspergillus niger_6.409090909_6.409090909

On a broader perspective, characterization of fungal secretion mechanisms is also for scientific fields, such as investigations into fungal pathogenicity. In industry and in the lab, enhanced production of enzymes is often achieved through mutagenesis and selection for enzyme hyperproducer mutants. One such Aspergillus lineage, Parent ATCC 13496; Mutant ATCC 13497, has been generated for the hyperproduction of an important enzyme glucoamylase. Sequencing of each strain in the lineage will enable the identification of the genomic changes that endow the mutants with the hyperproduction phenotype.

It is the causative agent of aspergillosis in sea fan corals and as such poses a threat to specific marine habitats (coral reefs), which play an important role in the carbon cycle. Attack by A. sydowii has devastating effects on sea fan corals, which are a dominant member of Caribbean coral reef ecosystems. With the development of a laboratory cnidarian pathosystem using Gorgonia ventalina (the common sea fan) and the causative fungal agent A. sydowii, cell biology studies of their interaction are now possible. Genomics data will greatly enhance molecular level studies of coral aspergillosis (in particular making it possible to perform transcriptomic and proteomic studies of this fungus during infection), such studies will increase the depth of understanding of the behavior of the fungus during pathogenic interactions. This will expand our knowledge of the mechanisms coral disease in general, and a greater understanding of the coral-fungus interaction will eventually lead to strategies to mitigate the effects of this particular disease. Utilization of genome data from A. fumigatus has lead to the identification of potential drug targets and improved our understanding of aspergillosis, setting a precedent for the use of genomics in the study of fungal pathogens. The relatively large A. sydowii genome and ability to grow as both a coral (animal) pathogen and on dead plant matter, suggests that A. sydowii has a more extensive spectra of extracellular enzymes than (most) other Aspergilli. The diversity of sampling locations of terrestrial isolates available in public collections, highlights the ability of A. sydowii to 11 grow on a broad range of substrates. Hence, we would predict A. sydowii to possess a set of extracellular enzymes specifically adapted to its unique environmental niche in addition to the core extracellular enzyme set which overlaps that of the other Aspergilli. It is anticipated that A. sydowii enzymes have evolved to suit its novel environmental niche (high salt and aquatic). Therefore, one would expect enzymes from A. sydowii to have biochemical properties differing to those of sequenced Aspergilli. In addition A. sydowii has been reported to produce a potent antimicrobial substance, mulundocandin, which belongs a structural class of compounds that possess a fungus specific mechanism of action and have a low incidence of unwanted side effects A.sydowii is therefore a potential source of fungal secondary metabolites of biomedical interest.",,,,Aspergillus sydowii_3.090909091_3.090909091

A large collaborative effort led by PI of this project, David Hibbett (Clark University) aims for master publication(s) of the SAP data analysis. Researchers who wish to publish analyses using data from unpublished SAP genomes are respectfully required to contact the PI and JGI to avoid potential conflicts on data use and coordinate other publications with the SAP master paper(s). This genome has been published. ; Auricularia subglabra is known only from montane cloud forests of Costa Rica (this genome was originally deposited under the name Auricularia delicata, which is a similar species, originally described from Africa, that may have a pantropical distribution). The genus Auricularia belongs to a morphological group called the ""jelly-fungi"" based on the gelatinous consistency of the fruiting bodies. Jelly-fungi have evolved independently in three classes of Agaricomycotina: Tremellomycetes, Dacrymycetes, and Agaricomycetes; the latter is roughly equivalent to the mushroom-forming fungi. Auricularia includes many edible species, such as the highly priced wood ear or Mu-Err fungus (A. auricula-judae) that play important roles in global economies. Reported medicinal properties including antilipemic and antiageing effects and immunological function increase in mice are attributed to some species, however, the beneficial compounds responsible have not been characterized in A. subglabra. Auricularia species produce a white rot on dead and decaying wood. Auricularia produces class II heme peroxidases (e.g., lignin peroxidases LiP and manganese peroxidases MnP) found in other groups of white rot fungi. In addition, dye-decolorizing peroxidases (DyP) with manganese-independent peroxidase activities have been demonstrated. Further studies are needed to assess the ligninolytic potential of DyP enzymes in the biodegradation and conversion of synthetic dyes that are harmful to the environment. The genome sequence of A. subglabra provides clues to the diversity of enzymes involved in white rot early in the evolution of Agaricomycetes. ; Looney, B. P., J. M. Birkebak and P. B. Matheny. 2013.

The Geminibasidiales are currently the closest order to the Wallemiales and together they form the earliest diverging lineage in Agaricomycotina. The fungi in these groups differ morphologically but they are united by their xerotolerant or xerophilic ecology and an absence of sexual fruiting bodies in culture. ; Basidioascus undulatus can be isolated by heat treating soil. It grows as a white colony and possesses a unique ontogenesis where basidia are forcibly discharged upon maturation. Basidia produce a single mature brown basidiospore attached by a sterigma. It also produces a simple asexual stage on some media with chains of thallic, single-celled conidia. ; The genome of the ex-type strain of B. undulatus (DAOM 241956) was sequenced with the Illumina paired end technology. Basidioascus undulatus was the first species in the order Geminibasidiales to be sequenced and could serve as a tool for evolution or genetic studies.

Cesati & De Notaris (anamorph Fusicoccum aesculi Corda) is the type species of the genus and Botryosphaeriaceae. The family includes a large number of species and genera with similar life histories. Most are known as latent plant pathogens that cause die-back, cankers, leaf spots or fruit rots on the plants they infect under conditions of stress. These fungi are widespread and common, almost ubiquitous, in endophytic communities in woody plants (Slippers & Wingfield 2007). The prominence of B. dothidea relates to its common occurrence in Europe (see recent assessment in Piskur et al. 2010) where members of Botryosphaeriaceae were commonly encountered and described by a number of mycologists in the 19th century. There has, however, been significant taxonomic confusion in Botryosphaeriaceae, which has led to numerous taxa and important plant pathogens being lumped under B. dothidea and a few close relatives. It was only after the application of DNA sequence-based phylogenetic tools and the epitypification of key species that the real taxonomic diversity in the group could be unraveled (Slippers et al. 2004). Although numerous species have since been described that have previously been confused with B. dothidea, it remains amongst the most widespread and important pathogens of trees around the world, including important fruit crops and forestry trees. Its hosts include trees such as Eucalyptus and Populus that are considered important for future fiber and potential energy production. The common occurrence and stress-associated diseases have led to the prediction that these fungi will play an important role as stress in plant communities increase due to climate change (Desprez-Loustau et al. 2006). The order Botryosphaeriales has only recently been introduced in Dothideomycetes to accommodate Botryosphaeriaceae as sole family (Schoch et al. 2006). The class is amongst the largest in the Ascomycota and encompasses a collective of very diverse nutritional modes, including plant and insect pathogens, lichens, marine fungi and saprobes. The Botryosphaeriales groups as sister to Tubeufiaceae and Histeriales that are predominantly saprobes or weak plant parasites, but also include other modes of nutrition. The prominence of the plant infecting life style, and pathogenicity activated by the onset of stress amongst species of Botryosphaeriales, suggest that analysis of genomes in this order could reveal much about the evolution of plant parasitism in Dothideomycetes. In particular the B. dothidea genome could hold unique discoveries related to its extended endophytic or latent stage, as well as its ability to infect a very wide host range.  References: Desprez-Loustau, M.L., Marcais, B., Nageleisen, L.M., Piou, D., Vannini, A., 2006.

(Syn= Ceratocystis fagacearum) is a fungal pathogen that is responsible for the widespread decline of oaks across the United States, particularly in Midwestern and Eastern USA and in Texas. It causes a disease known as oak wilt (OW) (Fig. 1). It is particularly devastating to trees in the red oak group, which can succumb to this disease within four weeks of infection. Spread of this disease is rapid and occurs on multiple fronts from root-to-root transmission, insect transmission, and sporadic long-range infections due to movement of firewood. Long-range spread is difficult to predict but most recently firewood was linked to increasing the north-eastern limit of B. fagacearum by 300km.B. fagacearum is the only member of its genus in the Ascomycete family Ceratocystidae; it is one of the few true vascular wilt diseases that occur in trees. An infected tree is often first noticed due to a sudden drop or browning of leaves in the summer months (Fig. 1A). Leaves may be brown, somewhat bronzed, or partially green. Often leaf tips and margins will be bronze or brown whilst the leaf base will remain green. B. fagacearum causes rapid death of trees via its ability to propagate rapidly through the water transport (xylem vessels) system of the tree. The rapid production of endoconidia (the asexual spore state) (Fig. 2) and the efforts of the tree to compartmentalize the fungus (through the production of tyloses) results in the clogging of xylem vessels and the classical wilting symptoms observed on the leaves of the tree (Fig. 1A).  Six to 12 months after the tree has died the fungus will complete its lifecycle and produce spore containing mycelial mats (Fig. 1D) on the dead tree. These mats form under the bark and as the mats mature, they produce specialized called “pressure pads” (in the center of fungal mat) that exert pressure outward causing the bark to split (Fig. 1B) and thus, provides a route for insects to reach the mycelial mats (which produce spores at time of maturity). These mycelial mats have a distinctive odor that makes them attractive to a variety of beetles (Fig. 1C) that will feed on the mat then fly to other mats or fresh tree wounds (through which the fungus then enters the tree and starts the infection process anew). Infection via beetle activity is known as overland spread. This form of spread is what creates new infection centers.  Approximately 90% of spread is attributed to root-grafts forming between oak trees. This form of below-ground spread creates outwardly expanding infection pockets.  The decline of oaks is an aesthetic blight across the landscape and also causes devastating ecosystem damage. There is no natural resistance to this disease in the red oak group and thus the only means of preserving these valuable trees is to mitigate the spread of OW to new locations and reduce inoculum load in known OW positive locations.",,,,Bretziella fagacearum_NA_NA

Researchers who wish to publish analyses using data from unpublished SAP genomes are respectfully required to contact the PI and JGI to avoid potential conflicts on data use and coordinate other publications with the SAP master paper(s). ; Calocera cornea is a jelly fungus, which is a descriptive term for a polyphyletic group of fungi with gelatinous, translucent fruiting bodies. This species occurs on decaying conifer wood. Calocera cornea is a member of the Dacrymycetes, which is the sister group of the Agaricomycetes (the group of Fungi that incudes the majority of mushroom-forming and wood decay species). Jelly fungi also occur in the Tremellomycetes, which is the sister group to the clade containing Dacrymycetes and Agaricomycetes, and in the Agaricomycetes itself. Calocera cornea is the third jelly fungus to be sequenced by the JGI, the others being Tremella mesenterica (Tremellomycetes), Auricularia delicata (Agaricomycetes), and Dacryopinax sp. (Dacrymycetes). A third species of Dacrymycetes, Calocera viscosa, will also be sequenced. This species is part of the Saprotrophic Agaricomycotina Project (SAP), which focuses on the evolution of decay capabilities in mushroom forming fungi (Agaricomycotina). A major motivation for targeting jelly fungi in the SAP, and the Dacrymycetes in particular, is that they may provide insight into the early origins of the white rot decay mode in the Agaricomycetes. An analysis of 31 fungal genomes by Floudas et al. (Science 336:1715-1719, 2012) suggested that the ancestor of the Agaricomycetes was a white rot fungus, meaning that it had the capacity to degrade the recalcitrant plant cell wall polymer lignin. The Floudas et al. study suggested that fungal class II peroxidases, which are enzymes that play a critical role in lignin decomposition, began to diversify early in the evolution of the Agaricomycetes, perhaps even before the divergence of Agaricomycetes and Dacrymycetes (based on gene tree/species tree reconciliation analyses). The Dacryopinax genome is devoid of genes encoding class II peroxidases, but there are some species of Dacrymycetes that are reported to produce a white rot, including Calocera viscosa. In contrast, Dacryopinax and C. cornea produce a brown rot, in which lignin is not appreciably degraded. By targeting this suite of Dacrymycetes, it should be possible to rigorously address the origin of class II peroxidases and white rot chemistry.",,,,Calocera cornea_8.5_3.25

Researchers who wish to publish analyses using data from unpublished SAP genomes are respectfully required to contact the PI and JGI to avoid potential conflicts on data use and coordinate other publications with the SAP master paper(s). ; Calocera viscosa (Pers.)Fr. is a member of the Dacrymycetes, which includes about 110 described species of so-called ""jelly fungi""; that are characterized by gelatinous to cartilaginous fruiting bodies that are usually bright yellow-orange. Most Dacrymycetes produce relatively simple fruiting bodies that are variously cylindrical, cup-shaped, resupinate, or cushion-shaped, but C. viscosa produces an elaborate coralloid fruiting body. Almost all Dacrymycetes are reported to produce a brown rot of wood (i.e., they remove cellulose and other carbohydrates, while leaving lignin largely intact), including Dacryopinax sp. and Calocera cornea, which have also been the subject of genome sequencing by the JGI. In contrast, C. viscosa is one of the few Dacrymcyetes that has been reported to produce a white rot (i.e., it degrades both lignin and cellulose). The Dacrymycetes form the sister group of the much larger clade Agaricomycetes, which includes about 21000 described species of mushroom-forming fungi. Molecular clock analyses suggest that the divergence of Dacrymycetes and Agaricomycetes occurred roughly 350 million years ago (near the boundary of the Devonian and Carboniferous periods).

C. albicans is a common member of human gut flora and is detectable in the gastrointestinal tract in 40% of healthy adults. It is usually a commensal organism, but can become pathogenic in immunocompetent individuals under a variety of conditions. Overgrowth of the fungus results in candidiasis (candidosis). Candidiasis is often observed in immunocompromised individuals, including HIV-infected patients. It commonly occurs on mucous membranes in the mouth or vagina, but may affect a number of other regions. C. albicans is responsible for 50–90% of all cases of candidiasis in humans. Systemic fungal infections (fungemias) including those by C. albicans have emerged as important causes of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised patients (e.g., AIDS, cancer chemotherapy, organ or bone marrow transplantation). C. albicans biofilms may form on the surface of implantable medical devices.

Although there is a history of light and electron microscopic studies, little molecular work has been done with this fungus, other than phylogenetic systematic studies (James et al., 2006; Porter et al., in prep). A genome sequence for C. anguillulae will aid the development of probes and primers for additional phylogenetic and environmental sampling studies that would facilitate identification and monitoring of wild isolates. After Allomyces macrogynus, this would be only the second member of the fungal phylum Blastocladiomycota with a sequenced genome. These species represent two of the most tractable organisms in the phylum, whereas other genera in the Blastocladiomycota represent obligate plant or insect pathogens that cannot be grown in the lab without their host, or opportunistic pathogens and saprophytes that are difficult to propagate in the lab because of slow growth rates and small fungal ""body"" size. Genome sequencing of non-model organisms can provide a valuable point of comparison for environmental metagenomic and metatranscriptomic studies. C. anguillulae may also be considered for its economic importance, as it is a facultative parasite of nematodes that can parasitize crop plants.

Analyses of these genomes will provide insight into the diversity of mechanisms for the mycorrhizal symbiosis, including ericoid-, orchid- and ectomycorrhizal associations. ; Cenococcum geophilum is an ascomycetous fungus placed into the Dothideomycetes, where it represents the only known ectomycorrhizal species within this large and ecologically diverse class of Ascomycota. C. geophilum is one of the most common and globally abundant genera of ectomycorrhizal fungi, forming black ectomycorrhizas with darkly pigmented, stringy hyphae emanating from root tips (Figure 1). It has a broad host- and habitat range and is often the dominant mycorrhizal fungus on the tree-root systems in forests of arctic, temperate and subtropical environments. Therefore, understanding its ecological role in forest ecosystems is of great significance. ; One of the important functions of the ectomycorrhizal symbiosis is an enhanced water uptake and drought resistance for host trees. Ectomycorrhizal tips of C. geophilum are strikingly abundant during drought when other mycorrhizal species decline. C. geophilum is highly resistant to desiccation. Genome-related functional studies will help elucidate whether and how the superior survival of C. geophilum under drought stress confers benefits to the host trees in water or nutrient uptake. ; Although being ubiquitous, the biology of C. geophilum is poorly understood. It forms sclerotia as resistant propagules (Figure 2), but no definitive sexual or asexual spore-producing structures are known. Studies of fine-scale diversity of C. geophilum populations, however, revealed a high level of genetic polymorphism amongst individuals consistent with the occurrence of recombination mechanisms and suggesting that the fungus is reproducing sexually in nature. The genomic sequence will help understand the reproductive biology of the genus and will make it an excellent candidate for population genomic studies on a global scale. ; Cenococcum geophilum strain 1.58 was isolated from a sclerotium in April 2008.

Bakshi was first described in 1976 (Cunningham et al., 1976). The type species C. bombacis was discovered on a Bombax ceiba leaf (Malvaceae) in Dehra Dun, India. The fungus was described as forming a sorus-like fructification on the lower surface of the leaf to produce discharged basidiospores. The hyphae were branched, septate and lacked clamp connections (Cunningham et al., 1976). After the first discovery, there have been no subsequent reports of Ceraceosorus in nature. The Ceraceosorus guamensis isolate (MCA4658) selected for genome sequencing was isolated from an asymptomatic leaf phylloplane in Guam. The fungus forms light to dark brown, cerebriform, crusty colonies on a potato dextrose agar (PDA). Microscopically, the fungus forms branched, septate hyphae without clamp connections. Fusiform-shaped conidia are produced at the tip of the hypha. Based on rDNA sequence comparisons, the genome isolate is a sister to C. bombacis, but sequence differences and examination of the type material suggest that the genome strain represents an undescribed species of Ceraceosorus, now named Ceraceosorus guamensis sp. nov. (Kijpornyongpan and Aime, 2016). Originally, the genus Ceraceosorus was included in Exobasidiales based on septum ultrastructure and presence of local interaction zones within a host cell (Begerow et al., 2006). However, subsequent molecular sequence analyses do not support the close relationship of Ceraceosorus with Exobasidiales or any other orders in Ustilaginomycotina. Thus, the new order Ceraceosorales was proposed, and its phylogenetic position remains unresolved (Begerow et al., 2006). The genome sequence of Ceraceosorus guamensis sp. nov. will provide the first whole genome reference sequence for a member of Ceraceosorales. Researchers will use these data in phylogenetic and phylogenomic reconstructions and in comparative genomics studies that seek to elucidate the molecular bases governing production of sexual and anamorphic states and the evolution of phytopathogenicity in Ustilaginomycotina. ;   ; References: ; Begerow D, Stoll M, Bauer R. 2006.

Thus, the CAsc are excellent candidates for studying the process of speciation, host adaptation and the evolution of mating behavior. ; Members of CAsc also show significant expansions in gene families associated with carbohydrate metabolism, particularly in families of xyloglucanases and other plant cell wall degrading enzymes and possibly contain the largest diversity of carbohydrate active enzymes in the Ascomycetes.

Wils. causes anthracnose stalk rot and leaf blight of maize. Maize is the dominant crop in the United States, with a value of more than 21 billion dollars in 2005, and a broad range of uses, from animal feed to sweeteners and fuel. C. graminicola is a major cause of stalk rot disease, one of the most economically important diseases of maize. Industry estimates are that stalk rots causes maize yield losses in the range of 6% annually. C. graminicola is likely to become an even more serious problem in the future, because it seems to cause a larger proportion of the stalk rots on maize engineered with the Bt transgene. C. graminicola also causes a leaf blight that is becoming increasingly important, particularly in the tropics and subtropics. C. graminicola is among the best characterized and most tractable of the Colletotrichum fungi. It is one of very few in which sexual crosses can be made (the teleomorph is Glomerella graminicola); it is easily cultured and stored; transformation and gene disruption are routine; and pathogenicity assays are straightforward. Maize, its host, is a classical genetic model as well as an important crop plant. Sequencing of the entire maize genome began in 2005 and should be completed soon. In 2006, the USDA/National Science Foundation Microbial Genome Sequencing Project National Research Initiative funded a project to sequence the genome of C. graminicola. C. graminicola strain M1.001 (also known as M2) is the first member of the Colletotrichum genus to be fully sequenced. C. graminicola strain M5.001 was sequenced to about 1X coverage by a research team at DuPont Nemours Inc.

In addition to its hemibiotrophic life-style, which involves differentiation of specialised infection structures, the fungus can be cultured in vitro and genetically transformed. The Colletotrichum-Arabidopsis interaction is therefore an important model pathosystem for investigating the molecular basis of fungal pathogenicity and host responses since both partners can be genetically manipulated. Phylogenetic analysis based on sequencing the ITS regions of rDNA indicates that C. higginsianum forms part of a group of closely-related taxa that also includes C. destructivum (tobacco and legume pathogen) and C. linicola (flax pathogen). A characteristic feature of all three species is that the initial biotrophic phase of infection is restricted to a single host epidermal cell, in contrast to other hemibiotrophic Colletotrichum species, including C. graminicola, which establish biotrophy in many host cells.",http://www.indexfungorum.org/Names/NamesRecord.asp?RecordID=170378,,,Colletotrichum higginsianum_16_3.25

(2007) and is known to contain several agriculturally important pathogenic species. Historically, this family included three genera: Schizoparme (sexual morph) and Coniella and Pilidiella (asexual morphs). This family has recently been re-evaluated by Alvarez et al. (2016). They provided an in-depth, historical analysis for each genus and resolved the classification through a five gene phylogenetic analysis combined with morphological observations. Importantly, they concluded that Coniella and Pilidiella were taxonomic synonyms with the oldest anamorphic name Coniella having precedence over the name of the asexual morph Pilidiella. ; Many Coniella species are large scale plant pathogens of economically valuable agricultural crops. Coniella granati (Sacc.) Petr. & Syd. infects Punica granatum L. (pomegranate) causing crown rot, fruit rot, and shoot blight in many countries including China, Greece, Iran, Italy, Spain, Turkey, and in the state of California in the United States. Coniella diplodiella (Speg.) Petr. & Syd. cause white rot of Vitis vinifera L. (wine grape) with up to 20-80% crop loss. In addition, Coniella species are known pathogens of Fragaria L. (strawberry) with C. castaneicola (Ellis & Everh.) B. Sutton causing fruit rot, and C. fragariae (Oudem.) B. Sutton causing leaf diseases. ; The genome of this fen-inhabiting species was sequenced with the hope that it will provide future insight into its enzymatic potential, ecological role, and be of value as a comparison to other Coniella species infecting economically valuable agricultural crops. ; References: ; Alvarez, L.

Researchers who wish to publish analyses using data from unpublished SAP genomes are respectfully required to contact the PI and JGI to avoid potential conflicts on data use and coordinate other publications with the SAP master paper(s). ; Coniophora puteana (Schum. ex Fries) Karst., commonly called the ""cellar"" fungus, is causing brown-rot damage that is similar to the one that the dry-rot fungus, Serpula lacrymans, produces. The name cellar fungus should not be taken too literally because the fungus can also infest the upper levels in a building. Dripping cold water pipes in bathrooms and leaking roof areas provide an optimal habitat for the fungus when leaks were not repaired. In contrast to S. lacrymans, C. puteana requires significantly higher moisture content in the substrate, preferably between 50 - 60%. Coniophora puteana primarily attacks the wood of conifers in its natural habitat and occasionally the wood of broad-leaved trees, including citrus trees. Like all other saprotrophs in the Boletales (e.g., Hydnomerulius, Leucogyrophana, Pseudomerulius, Serpula, Tapinella), C. puteana is capable of exhibiting cellulolytic activity against non-associated cellulose in culture, which is an unusual characteristic for fungi associated with a brown rot. Four genes encoding for glycoside hydrolase (GH) in the families 6 and 7 have been detected in C. puteana that are essential for the degradation of crystalline cellulose. The genes are absent from the recently released Postia placenta genome, suggesting that C. puteana and P. placenta have different cellulolytic systems, although they are both producing a brown rot. There may be as many as four independent origins of brown rot in the Boletales and the genomic sequence of C. puteana will provide insights in the evolution of brown-rotting systems in this group by comparing the presence of lignocellulolytic enzymes found in S. lacrymans. In addition, the genomic sequence of C. puteana will contribute to a better prospect of brown rot as a fungal nutritional mode, which apparently harbors more than only one ecological strategy.",,,,Coniophora puteana_11.36842105_7

Its goal is to release a 10X genome sequence coverage for Coprinus cinereus, strain Okayama 7 (#130). The Coprinus genome project is a partnership between the Broad Institute and the Coprinus research community. Genomic DNA for the genome project was provided by Patricia Pukkila at University of North Carolina. Broad produced whole genome shotgun sequence from 4kb & 10kb plasmids and 40kb Fosmids. The resulting 10X assembly was made public July 2003. This Whole Genome Shotgun project has been deposited at DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank under the project accession AACS00000000. The results of automated genome annotation will be made public in the Fall 2003 releases. What is Coprinus cinereus? ; General Description ; Coprinus cinereus is a multicellular basidiomycete with a typical mushroom form that undergoes a complete sexual cycle. Unlike most mushrooms, C. cinereus can complete its entire life cycle (2 weeks) in the laboratory. Its easy cultivation on simple defined media permits extensive genetic and molecular analysis. Spores of each mating type produce a monokaryotic mycelium. The fusion of compatible hyphae establishes a dikaryotic mycelium that forms a fruiting body - a miniature mushroom with three distinct tissues (gill, stalk, and cap). The primordium grows and the basidial cells of the hymenial layers in the gills initiate and complete nuclear fusion, meiosis, and haploid basidiospore formation. Spore maturation and active discharge from the cap are accompanied by elongation of the stalk and autodigestion of the remaining gill tissue. ; Significance ; Genomic analysis will reveal whether the genes responsible for the multicellularity of Coprinus cinereus are the progenitors of those in other multicellular organisms (e.g., nuclear receptors) or are innovations restricted to the fungal kingdom. Coprinus cinereus is a higher fungus (Agaricales) comprised of many cell types and, therefore, provides a window on the development of multicellularity within a single kingdom. The cells of this organism undergo coordinated developmental events not observed in unicellular fungi, including secondary and tertiary gill formation, cap expansion and autodigestion, active spore discharge, and stalk elongation, phototropism, and gravitropism. ; Genome Facts ; The haploid genome size of C. cinereus is estimated at 37.5 Mb. The 13 chromosomes range in size from 1-5 Mb. Over 100 markers affecting mating type, hyphal growth, fruit body morphogenesis, and DNA repair have been assigned to 10 linkage groups. Coprinus cinereus is easily transformed by DNA, and targeted gene disruption is achieved in some instances. Both RFLP and RAPD markers are widely utilized. Duplicated genes frequently become methylated at CpG dinucleotides. Chromosome-specific cosmid libraries have been prepared for 8 of the 13 chromosomes. Both commercially prepared cDNA libraries and a cDNA library suitable for yeast two-hybrid screens are available. A partial contig map of the smallest chromosome (~1 Mb) has been assembled and its sequence is currently being determined.",,,,Coprinopsis cinerea_8_3

Mostly known as a necrotrophic plant pathogen, C. cassiicola was also described as an endophyte or a saprobe. It was also reported in humans.C. cassiicola is one of the hundred Corynespora species described so far.

An important diversity was evidenced within the C. cassiicola species, both in terms of genetics and biology. A small secreted protein named cassiicolin was described as an important effector of rubber tree pathogenic isolates. The cassiicolin gene polymorphism was concordant with the phylogenetic structuration of C. cassiicola, suggesting that this small secreted toxin plays an important role in the evolution of the species. However, other pathogen effectors may be involved and the mechanisms ruling pathogenicity and host specificity are still poorly understood. The analysis of C. cassiicola genome will allow a more detailed investigation of the biology of the fungus in terms of effectors, nutrition mode, reproduction, in order to better understand it evolution and the genetic basis of disease emergence.Corynespora cassiicola was contributed to the 1KFG project by Francis Martin (INRA) and Valérie Pujade-Renaud (CIRAD).

Crucibulum belongs to a small family containing bird’s nest fungi, which are characterized by unusual, urn-shaped fruiting bodies that contain black, disc-shaped reproductive structures, called peridioles. Peridioles contain basidia and basidiospores and are spread by falling raindrops. This unusual way of spore dispersal makes them somewhat similar to puffballs (e.g. Lycoperdon and Bovista spp.), however, unlike puffballs, where clouds of spores are released by raindrops, peridioles of bird’s nest fungi are expelled as a whole by falling raindrops. Bird’s nest fungi colonize dead woody materials, nutrient-rich soil or dung. Wood-inhabiting species of the family cause white rot on the colonized wood; their lignocellulose-degrading enzymes have been subject to intense research.  Bird’s nest fungi have internally developing spores, which has led mycologists classify them in the Gasteromycetes (puffballs in a wide sense) in the past. However, molecular studies based on nuclear and mitochondrial ribosomal DNA revealed that they belong to the Agaricales, where their exact affinities have remained unknown. Its position within the Agaricales implies that their unique fruiting body morphology likely evolved from agaricoid ancestors (mushrooms with can and stalk), through a complete loss of cap, stipe and other structures commonly found in mushrooms.

The data (genome assembly and gene predictions) were obtained from GenBank (record PRJNA10698). In order to facilitate comparative fungal genomics a copy of this database was incorporated into MycoCosm. The JGI pipeline was used to functionally annotate the predicted genes. ; The following text was part of the GenBank record: ; Cryptococcus neoformans (teleomorph: Filobasidiella neoformans ) is an opportunistic pathogenic fungus found world-wide. It is soil-born and is associated with avian excrement, especially pigeon droppings. It is the most common cause of fungal meningoencephalitis in individuals with compromised cell-mediated immunity, especially in AIDS patients. Occasionally the fungus can infect apparently healthy individuals. Cryptococcal disease is acquired via inhalation of haploid yeast or basidiospores from the environment.Genus Filobasidiella contains approximately 38 Cryptococcus species. A few are pathogenic and constitute the pathogenic Cryptococcus species cluster. Two of the species, Cryptococcus neoformans and Cryptococcus bacillisporus, are the casual agents of the majority of human and animal cryptococcosis. This genus typically reproduces asexually as haploid, encapsulated budding yeast, but may also be dispersed by means of sexually produced basidiospores. Its mating type locus (MAT) contains more than 20 genes. Usually MAT-a and MAT-alpha cells are involved in mating. However same-sex mating between two MAT-alpha cells has also been observed. Sexual reproduction can play an important role in contributing to virulence of the pathogen. Based on the differences in capsule polysaccharides, Cryptococcus is traditionally subdivided into 5 serotypes - A, B, C, D and AD. The polysaccharide capsule protects the fungus from the host's immune system and is considered a key factor in determining the virulence of cryptococcal infections and disease. Another characteristic that can be used to subdivide the Cryptococcus species is unique molecular types (genotypes).There are two varieties of Cryptococcus neoformans recognized: C. neoformans var. grubii, serotype A and C. neoformans var. neoformans, serotype D. Most isolates are MAT-alpha type which is significantly more virulent than the MAT-a.There are four molecular types of Cryptococcus neoformans recognized: VNI (serotype A), VNII (serotype A), VNIII (serotype AD) and VNIV (serotype D). The majority of the isolates from cryptococcal infections worldwide are VNI with the remainder being reported as one of the other three genotypes.The C. neoformans genome is approximately 19 Mb, organized in 14 chromosomes. ;   ; When using these data, please cite: ; The Genome of the Basidiomycetous Yeast and Human Pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans ; Brendan J.

The serotype D was the first serotype chosen for sequencing studies at The Institute for Genome Research and Stanford Genome Technology Center because of its advanced genetic tools. However, more than 90% of clinical isolates and more than 99% of isolates from AIDS patients are of the more divergent serotype A strains. Sequencing a serotype A strain will increase our understanding of this disease and comparative studies between the serotypes A and D will help us define the genome structure and the development of pathogenicity. General Description    ;  Cryptococcus neoformans is unique among the most common human fungal pathogens in that it is a basidiomycete, thus it is evolutionarily divergent from the more common pathogenic ascomycetes (e.g., Candida albicans) and more closely related to wood rotting fungi (e.g., Phanerochaete chrysosporium), mushrooms (e.g., Coprinus cinereus), and plant pathogens (e.g., Ustilago maydis). Cryptococcus neoformans elaborates two specialized virulence factors, the polysaccharide capsule, which inhibits phagocytosis, and melanin, which serves as an antioxidant. The typical vegetative form of C. neoformans is the yeast form. The organism can also undergo sexual reproduction and form basidiospores. Sexual reproduction appears to occur much less frequently in nature than asexual or vegetative reproduction. Genome Facts    ;  Most isolates of C. neoformans are haploid. The size of the genome is approximately 19 Mb with 14 chromosomes. Cryptococcus neoformans has a defined sexual cycle involving mating between cells of the MATalpha and MATa types. Thus, classical genetic approaches can be applied to study this organism.  ",,,,Cryptococcus neoformans_4.416666667_1.583333333

Unlike that species, however, Cylindrobasidium has a simple, crust-like fruiting body, covering the surface of woody substrate. This so-called resupinate fruiting body type is believed to be ancestral in the Agaricomycetes, independently giving rise to more complex morphologies. Because Cylindrobasidium is closely related to Armillaria, for which a genome sequence is also being produced, this pair of species will provide us with an excellent resource to study the genomic changes underlying changes in complexity level in mushroom fruiting bodies. Understanding the genetic bases of fruiting body evolution in the Agaricomycetes may directly contribute to the improvement of commercial mushroom production. The Cylindrobasidium genome. Together with that of Armillaria, will also contribute to understanding of the genetic bases of switches between decayer and timber pathogen lifestyles.  In addition to fruiting body evolution, the genome sequence of Cylindrobasidium will contribute to understanding the phylogenetic relationships in the Agaricales.

Ten new combinations were introduced, several of which were previously classified as Ilyonectria. Dactylonectria macrodidyma (previously known as Ilyonectria macrodidyma) is a species that associate with black-foot disease, one of the most destructive grapevine trunk diseases in nurseries and young vineyards. Dactylonectria macrodidyma and other Dactylonectria spp. are common soil fungi, opportunistic plant root pathogens, or non-symptomatic root endophytes. Dactylonectria macrodidyma MPI-CAGE-AT-0147 has been isolated from healthy Arabidopsis thaliana plants grown in natural soil after surface sterilization of plant roots. The sequencing of this fungal isolate is part of a larger project aiming at sequencing the genomes of numerous phylogenetically diverse root-associated fungi from Arabidopsis, Populus, and other plant hosts for further comparative genome analysis. Unravelling the genomic signatures reflecting the adaptation of these microbes to the host cell environment represent a promising way to better understand how the endophytic lifestyle evolved in phylogenetically unrelated fungal species. Comparative genome analysis between different plant hosts, and between saprotrophic, mycorrhizal, and pathogenic fungi will provide new insights into the specific adaptations but also the conserved signatures associated with these different lifestyles. ; Researchers who wish to publish analyses using data from unpublished CSP genomes are respectfully required to contact the PI and JGI to avoid potential conflicts on data use and coordinate other publications with the CSP master paper(s).",,,,Dactylonectria macrodidyma_17_17

The species is collected mainly on conifer trees and usually causes major damages to the economically important conifer Pinus ponderosa (Ponderosa Pine). Various types of enzymatic activities related with the ligninocellulolytic system have been shown in liquid cultures of Dichomitus squalens such as endoglucanases, cellobiohydrolases, xylanases, galacturonases and cellobiose dehydrogenases.  It has also been shown to produce laccases and manganese peroxidases on both liquid and solid cultures with wheat straw and pine wood chips. Furthermore the species can effectively degrade synthetic dyes in liquid media such as azo and triphenylmethane dyes. The white rot biochemistry makes the species a good candidate for studies on lignin and cellulose degradation. The genome sequencing of Dichomitus squalens will provide more information on the ligninocellulolytic potential of the Basidiomycetes and will give us the tools for extensive studies in this field. Additionally, the genome of this species will give us the opportunity to obtain more information on how the species so efficiently attack the economically important Ponderosa Pine. What is more, the synthetic dye degradation ability of the species is a promising factor for applications on bioremediation studies.

To date, more than 1,200 microsporidian species have been described, and at least 13 of these species infect humans; many are opportunistic pathogens found in immune-compromised patients.

Complete genome sequences from two species were found to encode about 2,000 genes making up a reduced set of sometimes simplified molecular and biochemical pathways. Their high degree of host dependence also is reflected in the relatively large number of transporters encoded in these genomes (e.g., ATP transporters), which allow them to acquire essential energy and nutrients from their hosts. Some of these transporters are thought to have originated by horizontal gene transfer (HGT), possibly from coexisting bacterial pathogens, and the recent finding of an animal-derived gene in both Encephalitozoon romaleae and Encephalitozoon hellem also raised the intriguing possibility that microsporidia can acquire genes from their hosts. ;   ;   ;  ","Carlos E.

Within the framework of this project, we are sequencing keystone lineages of saprophytic, mycorrhizal, and endophytic fungi that are of special ecological importance. Dozens of sequenced species were harvested from Long Term Observatories to serve as the foundation for a reference database for metagenomics of fungi and for a comprehensive survey of the soil fungal metatranscriptome. Within this project we originally planned to sequence the fungus Clitopilus paseckianus, but sequencing data suggested that the sample was heavily contaminated with this Epicoccum species. This contamination is believed to have originated in the original culture. Little to no Clitopilus was assembled and its reads have been removed from the assembly. The contaminant organism was released as a metagenome assembled genome. Similarly, the RNA library was contaminated and only Epicoccum genome-mapping reads were used for transcriptome assembly. ; Epicoccum nigrum is a robust and ubiquitous mycoparasite, plant pathogen and endophyte found in the Americas, Asia, and Europe. Epicoccum nigrum produces a variety of biomedically and industrially useful metabolites, including important antifungal agents and pigments, including: flavipin, epicorazines A and B, epirodin, epicocconone, and a variety of carotenoid pigments. Epicoccum nigrum has also been utilized in the biosynthetic manufacture of silver- and gold nanoparticles. ; Epicoccum nigrum has no known teleomorph and forms blastoconidia that are darkly coloured, warted and spherical, reaching 15 to 25 µm in diameter. Conidia grow on a sporodochium, formed by warty and fibrous hyphae. Sporets have been found to contain up to 15 cells. The spores of E. nigrum are actively released depending on temperature, light, and relative humidity conditions. The mechanism of release involves the separation of the conidium from the sporodochium via a double septum. It capitalizes on the spherical shape of the conidia, allowing it to ""bounce"" off the sporodochium. Conidia then become airborne with movement or wind. Sporulation is induced under Wood's light, or sometimes upon exposure to cold temperatures with a subsequent return to room temperature. Pigment production is also sensitive to light and temperature changes. ; Researchers who wish to publish analyses using data from unpublished CSP genomes are respectfully required to contact the PI and JGI to avoid potential conflicts on data use and coordinate other publications with the CSP master paper(s).",,,,Epicoccum nigrum_22.07142857_21

It eventually covers the entire leaf surface with spores, giving the disease a white powdery appearance. Conidia are cylindrical in shape and are produced singly on aerial unbranched conidiophores. Appressoria are multi-lobed, usually occurring singly on hyphae. Haustoria are smooth, ovoid to round in shape, and formed within plant epidermal cells (Falloon and Vijanen-Rollinson, 2001).

It has a reduced genome in terms of both size and gene content relative to closely related hypocrealean fungi such as Trichoderma or Hypomyces (de Man et al., 2016). Although primary metabolism genes have been retained, the E. weberi genome is depleted in carbohydrate active enzymes, which is consistent with reliance on a host with these functions. E. weberi has also lost genes considered necessary for sexual reproduction. Contrasting these losses, the genome encodes unique secondary metabolite biosynthesis clusters, some of which include genes that exhibit up-regulated expression during host attack. Thus, the specialized nature of the interaction between Escovopsis and ant agriculture is reflected in the parasite’s genome. ; The genome sequence and gene models of Escovopsis weberi CC031208-10 were not determined by the Joint Genome Institute (JGI), but were downloaded from NCBI on Jan 29, 2020 and annotation provided by the authors.

Tang et al., 2012). Please note that this copy of the genome is not maintained by the author and is therefore not automatically updated. ; F. radiculosa is a brown rot fungus that has been documented to cause a premature failure of wooden stakes treated with copper-based wood preservatives in the field. Species of brown rot fungi that show copper tolerance in laboratory tests include F. radiculosa, Postia placenta, and Fomitopsis palustris, and all three can secrete high levels of oxalate. Oxalate is believed to confer metal tolerance to fungi because it chelates metal to form insoluble metal oxalate crystals. A related species, Serpula lacrymans, causes a specialized form of brown rot decay called dry rot. It is less copper tolerant and secretes lower levels of oxalate. Because the majority of wood preservatives are copper based, an understanding of the mechanisms of copper tolerance has become a priority for research in wood protection. Brown rot fungi are also aggressive decomposers of wood. Their particular mode of attack, however, is selective. They work around the lignin, targeting the rapid deconstruction and utilization of hemicellulose and cellulose. Since each cellulose molecule in wood is comprised of an average of 10,000 glucose units, the biochemical mechanisms involved in brown rot decay may have potential application for biofuel production. ;   ;   ; ",,,,Fibroporia radiculosa_6.5_3.25

In addition to being significant as a white rot fungus and plant pathogen, F. mediterranea is the first representative of the order Hymenochaetales to have its genome sequenced. The Hymenochaetales includes diverse wood decay fungi that produce an aggressive white rot and that are often dominant components of wood decay communities (e.g., Hymenochaete, Hydnochaete, Phellinus, Trichaptum), including pathogens that attack live woody plants, and saprotrophs that inhabit dead wood. Prior studies using polymerase chain reaction amplification of class II fungal peroxidases indicated that F. mediterranea possesses manganese peroxidases that are similar to those of the distantly related model white rot organism Phanerochaete chrysosporium, which is in the Polyporales (Morgenstern et al. 2010). The F. mediterranea genome will provide a first look at the complete decay apparatus of an important clade of wood-degrading basidiomycetes that may have unique features of potential applied utility that are not found in the currently best known model systems for decay biology and biochemistry. ; Amalfi, M., P.

The fungus can cause damping-off and root-rot of conifer seedlings in forest nurseries but also can cause disease on Soybean and other crops. Fusarium commune is a soil inhabiting fungus that primarily infects plant roots to cause disease, although some Fusarium commune strains have been detected in or isolated from the roots of healthy plants. The sequenced Fusarium sp. MPI-SDFR-AT-0072 has been isolated from healthy Arabidopsis thaliana plants grown in natural soil after surface sterilization of plant roots. This suggest either that its corresponding gene repertoire lacks important virulence factors required for A. thaliana invasion or that its pathogenicity is reduced in a community context. The sequencing of this fungal isolate is part of a larger project aiming at sequencing the genomes of numerous phylogenetically diverse root-associated fungi from Arabidopsis, Populus, and other plant hosts for further comparative genome analysis. Unravelling the genomic signatures reflecting the adaptation of these microbes to the host cell environment represents a promising way to better understand how the endophytic lifestyle evolved in phylogenetically unrelated fungal species. Comparative genome analysis between different plant hosts, and between saprotrophic, mycorrhizal, and pathogenic fungi will provide new insights into the specific adaptations but also the conserved signatures associated with these different lifestyles. ; Researchers who wish to publish analyses using data from unpublished CSP genomes are respectfully required to contact the PI and JGI to avoid potential conflicts on data use and coordinate other publications with the CSP master paper(s).",,,,Fusarium commune_22.53333333_4.691666667

The fungus can cause severe losses in many vegetables and flowers, field crops, such as cotton, and plantation crops, such as banana, date palm and oil palm. More than 120 different formae speciales have been identified based on specificity to host species. Although many formae speciales cause vascular wilt disease, some are not primarily vascular pathogens, but cause foot and root rot or bulb rot. Notably, several Fusarium oxysporum isolates have been isolated from healthy looking plants and numerous examples of nonpathogenic strains that can be used as biocontrol agents to reduce fusarium wilt incidence have been reported. The sequenced Fusarium oxysporum MPI-CAGE-CH-0212 has been isolated from surface sterilized roots of Cardamine hirsuta (a relative of Arabidopsis thaliana) grown in the Cologne Agricultural Soil (CAS). This suggest either that its corresponding gene repertoire lacks important virulence factors required for plant invasion or that its pathogenicity is reduced in a community context. The sequencing of this fungal isolate is part of a larger project aiming at sequencing the genomes of numerous phylogenetically diverse root-associated fungi from Arabidopsis, Populus, and other plant hosts for further comparative genome analysis.

The fungus can cause severe losses in many vegetables and flowers, field crops, such as cotton, and plantation crops, such as banana, date palm and oil palm. More than 120 different formae speciales have been identified based on specificity to host species (Michielse and Rep 2009). Although many formae speciales cause vascular wilt disease, some are not primarily vascular pathogens, but cause foot and root rot or bulb rot. Notably, several Fusarium oxysporum isolates have been isolated from healthy looking plants and numerous examples of nonpathogenic strains that can be used as biocontrol agents to reduce fusarium wilt incidence have been reported (Nel et al. 2006). The sequenced Fusarium oxysporum MPI-SDFR-AT-0094 strain has been isolated from healthy Arabidopsis thaliana plants grown in natural soil after surface sterilization of plant roots. This suggest either that its corresponding gene repertoire lacks important virulence factors required for plant invasion or that its pathogenicity is reduced in a community context. The sequencing of this fungal isolate is part of a larger project aiming at sequencing the genomes of numerous phylogenetically diverse root-associated fungi from Arabidopsis, Populus, and other plant hosts for further comparative genome analysis. Unravelling the genomic signatures reflecting the adaptation of these microbes to the host cell environment represent a promising way to better understand how the endophytic lifestyle evolved in phylogenetically unrelated fungal species.

This disease is the major constraint that impedes the development of date palm sector in Morocco. Bayoud first appeared in Darâa Valley in southeastern Morocco in the late 19th century. From there, the disease swept eastbound across all date palm growing regions in Morocco. It is assumed that this was due to plant material exchange that’s taken place between growers from different regions. The most effective way for disease management is genetic resistance. One major hurdle to breeding for resistant cultivars is the lack of understanding of the molecular bases that underlie the interactions between date palm and Foa. This is partly due to the lack of a reference genome and poor insight into Foa population diversity and structure. Although previous work based on VCG, RAPD and RLFP analyses suggests single clonal lineage of Moroccan Foa populations, these investigations do not provide deep insight into genetic variability and pathogenicity factors.

This disease is the major constraint that impedes the development of date palm sector in Morocco. Bayoud first appeared in Darâa Valley in southeastern Morocco in the late 19th century. From there, the disease swept eastbound across all date palm growing regions in Morocco. It is assumed that this was due to plant material exchange that’s taken place between growers from different regions. The most effective way for disease management is genetic resistance. One major hurdle to breeding for resistant cultivars is the lack of understanding of the molecular bases that underlie the interactions between date palm and Foa. This is partly due to the lack of a reference genome and poor insight into Foa population diversity and structure. Although previous work based on VCG, RAPD and RLFP analyses suggests single clonal lineage of Moroccan Foa populations, these investigations do not provide deep insight into genetic variability and pathogenicity factors. Whole genome sequencing my offer greater opportunities to better understand Foa pathogenomics and set the stage for future investigations on genetic variability and population structure.",,,,Fusarium oxysporum_15.5_6.5

As plant pathogens, FOSC strains can cause wilt and root rot diseases on over 120 plant species (Michielse and Rep, 2009). Many FOSC strains can infect plant roots without apparent effect or can even protect plants from subsequent infection (Alabouvette et al., 2009). FOSC isolates also have been identified as human pathogens causing localized or disseminated infections that may become life-threatening in neutropenic individuals (O'Donnell et al., 2004). The first genome made available in 2007 was from a tomato wilt strain FOL 4287 (NRRL 34936) which was used for comparative analysis with the genomes of F. graminearum and F. verticillioides. Results of this comparison led to the discovery of mobile supernumerary chromosomes in this strain of F. oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici (race 2 - VCG 0030) containing genes required for host specific infection and disease (Ma et al., 2010). ; References : ;  ",,,,Fusarium oxysporum_15.5_6.5

This disease is the major constraint that impedes the development of date palm sector in Morocco. Bayoud first appeared in Darâa Valley in southeastern Morocco in the late 19th century. From there, the disease swept eastbound across all date palm growing regions in Morocco. It is assumed that this was due to plant material exchange that’s taken place between growers from different regions. The most effective way for disease management is genetic resistance. One major hurdle to breeding for resistant cultivars is the lack of understanding of the molecular bases that underlie the interactions between date palm and Foa. This is partly due to the lack of a reference genome and poor insight into Foa population diversity and structure. Although previous work based on VCG, RAPD and RLFP analyses suggests single clonal lineage of Moroccan Foa populations, these investigations do not provide deep insight into genetic variability and pathogenicity factors.

In order to allow comparative analyses with other fungi, a copy of this genome was imported into MycoCosm. Fungi of the Fusarium oxysporum species complex (FOSC) are ubiquitous soil and plant inhabiting microbes. As plant pathogens, FOSC strains can cause wilt and root rot diseases on over 120 plant species (Michielse and Rep, 2009). Many FOSC strains can infect plant roots without apparent effect or can even protect plants from subsequent infection (Alabouvette et al., 2009). FOSC isolates also have been identified as human pathogens causing localized or disseminated infections that may become life-threatening in neutropenic individuals (O'Donnell et al., 2004). The first genome made available in 2007 was from a tomato wilt strain FOL 4287 (NRRL 34936) which was used for comparative analysis with the genomes of F. graminearum and F. verticillioides. Results of this comparison led to the discovery of mobile supernumerary chromosomes in this strain of F. oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici (race 2 - VCG 0030) containing genes required for host specific infection and disease (Ma et al., 2010). ; References : ;  ",,,,Fusarium oxysporum_15.5_6.5

The fungus can cause severe losses in many vegetables and flowers, field crops, such as cotton, and plantation crops, such as banana, date palm and oil palm. More than 120 different formae speciales have been identified based on specificity to host species. Although many formae speciales cause vascular wilt disease, some are not primarily vascular pathogens, but cause foot and root rot or bulb rot. Notably, several Fusarium oxysporum isolates have been isolated from healthy looking plants and numerous examples of nonpathogenic strains that can be used as biocontrol agents to reduce fusarium wilt incidence have been reported. The sequenced Fusarium oxysporum MPI-CAGE-CH-0212 has been isolated from surface sterilized roots of Cardamine hirsuta (a relative of Arabidopsis thaliana) grown in the Cologne Agricultural Soil (CAS). This suggest either that its corresponding gene repertoire lacks important virulence factors required for plant invasion or that its pathogenicity is reduced in a community context. The sequencing of this fungal isolate is part of a larger project aiming at sequencing the genomes of numerous phylogenetically diverse root-associated fungi from Arabidopsis, Populus, and other plant hosts for further comparative genome analysis.

The fungus can cause severe losses in many vegetables and flowers, field crops, such as cotton, and plantation crops, such as banana, date palm and oil palm. More than 120 different formae speciales have been identified based on specificity to host species (Michielse and Rep 2009). Although many formae speciales cause vascular wilt disease, some are not primarily vascular pathogens, but cause foot and root rot or bulb rot. Notably, several Fusarium oxysporum isolates have been isolated from healthy looking plants and numerous examples of nonpathogenic strains that can be used as biocontrol agents to reduce fusarium wilt incidence have been reported (Nel et al. 2006). The sequenced Fusarium oxysporum MPI-SDFR-AT-0094 strain has been isolated from healthy Arabidopsis thaliana plants grown in natural soil after surface sterilization of plant roots. This suggest either that its corresponding gene repertoire lacks important virulence factors required for plant invasion or that its pathogenicity is reduced in a community context. The sequencing of this fungal isolate is part of a larger project aiming at sequencing the genomes of numerous phylogenetically diverse root-associated fungi from Arabidopsis, Populus, and other plant hosts for further comparative genome analysis. Unravelling the genomic signatures reflecting the adaptation of these microbes to the host cell environment represent a promising way to better understand how the endophytic lifestyle evolved in phylogenetically unrelated fungal species.

This disease is the major constraint that impedes the development of date palm sector in Morocco. Bayoud first appeared in Darâa Valley in southeastern Morocco in the late 19th century. From there, the disease swept eastbound across all date palm growing regions in Morocco. It is assumed that this was due to plant material exchange that’s taken place between growers from different regions. The most effective way for disease management is genetic resistance. One major hurdle to breeding for resistant cultivars is the lack of understanding of the molecular bases that underlie the interactions between date palm and Foa. This is partly due to the lack of a reference genome and poor insight into Foa population diversity and structure. Although previous work based on VCG, RAPD and RLFP analyses suggests single clonal lineage of Moroccan Foa populations, these investigations do not provide deep insight into genetic variability and pathogenicity factors. Whole genome sequencing my offer greater opportunities to better understand Foa pathogenomics and set the stage for future investigations on genetic variability and population structure.",,,,Fusarium oxysporum_15.5_6.5

Members of the FSSC have collectively a broad host range and can be found as soil-inhabiting saprophytes, rhizosphere colonizers, or as pathogens, which cause disease on many plant and animal species, including humans. They have been previously grouped into formae speciales based on host speci<U+FB01>city. However, phylogenetic studies indicate that these formae speciales correspond to phylogenetically distinct species, most of which remain unnamed. Genome sequencing of some of these fungi revealed that genes controlling the ability of the fungus to colonize specific hosts or habitats are located on supernumerary chromosomes. Notably, several Fusarium solani isolates have been isolated from healthy looking plants and numerous examples of nonpathogenic strains have been reported. The sequenced Fusarium solani FSSC 5 has been isolated from healthy Arabidopsis thaliana plants grown in natural soil after surface sterilization of plant roots. This suggest either that its corresponding gene repertoire lacks important virulence factors required for Arabidopsis invasion or that its pathogenicity is reduced in a community context.

Unraveling the genomic signatures reflecting the adaptation of these microbes to the host cell environment represent a promising way to better understand how the endophytic lifestyle evolved in phylogenetically unrelated fungal species.

Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) perform vital functions in the phosphorus cycle that are fundamental to sustainable crop plant productivity. The unusual biological features of AMF – ubiquist and abundant obligate biotrophs associated with 80% of plants - have long fascinated evolutionary biologists. It has been suggested that the AMF maintain a stable assemblage of several different genomes during the life cycle, but this genomic organization has been questioned. In 2013, we have published the first genome of an AM fungus: Rhizophagus irregularis strain DAOM197198 (Glomerales). A unique haploid genome was identified in this strain with a repertoire of 28,232 genes. Glomeromycota are formed by distinct clades. Although AMF species have a very broad host spectrum, they differ by their fitness to plant genotypes and environment. ; Gigaspora rosea DAOM 194757 ; Species from the family of Gigasporaceae (Order Diversipsorales) form large hyphae and big spores (>200µm). According to plant hosts, Gigaspora spp can develop different types of intracellular structures, i.e. arbuscules and coils. Gigaspora rosea DAOM194757 can be easily cultivated on entire plant in pots and in vitro on root organ culture. Due to their ability to form long germinating hyphae, it was used to characterize the response to strigolactones (an early plant symbiotic signals) and the synthesis of lipo-chito-oligosaccharides (fungal symbiotic signals). G. rosea is mainly found in non perturbed soil. Genome comparison with R. irregularis and other phylogenetically distinct species will give clues in deciphering shared and specific features involved in the symbiotic biology of AM fungi. ; Collaborators: ; Biological material production: Dr Sébastien Roy and Julie Viala (Agronutrition- Labège, France) , Dr Nianwu Tang (LRSV-Toulouse)  RNAseq material and analyses: Dr Nianwu Tang and Pr Christophe Roux (LRSV-Toulouse)  Genome assembly: Hélène San Clemente (LRSV-Toulouse) and Dr Claude Murat (INRA IAM-Nancy)  Annotation: Emmanuelle Morin (INRA IAM-Nancy)  Coordinators: Dr Francis Martin (INRA IAM-Nancy) and Pr Christophe Roux (LRSV-Toulouse)",,,,Gigaspora rosea_267.5_267.5

Please note that this copy of the genome is not maintained by the author and is therefore not automatically updated. ; Glarea lozoyensis is an anamorphic species of the Helotiaceae of medical relevance because it produces a family of lipohexapeptides, named pneumocandins, natural antifungals which act by inhibiting fungal ß-(1,3)-glucan synthesis. A semisynthetic derivative of pneumocandin B0, caspofungin acetate, marketed as CANCIDAS™ since 2001, was the first echinocandin antibiotic brought to the market and has provided invaluable contributions to antifungal therapy to treat serious life-threatening fungal infections (Balkovec et al. 2013). Glarea lozoyensis was first isolated from a water sample from Madrid, Spain, in 1985, and its antifungal activity in a yeast cell wall inhibition assay was detected in 1986. The earliest reports of the pneumocandins misidentified the fungus as Zalerion arboricola (Schwartz et al. 1989, Schwartz et al. 1992). The pneumocandin producer was later shown to be very different to authentic Z. arboricola strains (Bills et al. 1999). Analyses of the ITS and 28S rDNA strains from Spain, Argentina and the USA have placed this enigmatic fungi within the order Helotiales where it is thought to be an anamorphic form of Crocicreas or Cyathicula (Peláez et al. 2011). ; The G. lozoyensis genome was sequenced, completely assembled and thoroughly annotated (Chen et al. 2013). The menu of about 50 secondary metabolites encoding genes was predicted from the genome, thus providing a greater understanding the complexity of primary and secondary metabolism in fungi from the yet poorly studied Leotiomycetes. The biosynthetic gene cluster responsible for pneumocandin was predicted in silico and identified by core gene glpks4 and glnrps4 knockouts and bioassay experiments. Study of the genome will enable a more detailed functional analysis of pneumocandin biosynthetic pathways and the identification of other antifungal lipohexapeptide pathways in other fungi, of which both will be essential for increasing pneumocandin production and for generating new pneumocandin and echinocandin derivatives via biocombinatorial chemistry approaches. ;   ; References ;   ;  ",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/21501203.2010.544334,,,Glarea lozoyensis_4.5_4.5

A large collaborative effort led by PI of this project, David Hibbett (Clark University) aims for master publication(s) of the SAP data analysis. Researchers who wish to publish analyses using data from unpublished SAP genomes are respectfully required to contact the PI and JGI to avoid potential conflicts on data use and coordinate other publications with the SAP master paper(s). ; Gloeophyllum trabeum is a brown rot fungus that has long been considered to belong to the Polyporales, but is now recognized as a member of the recently established order Gloeophyllales. Brown rot fungi have evolved multiple times independently in several lineages of the Basidiomycota, one origin is found in the Gloeophyllales. This small order of Agaricomycetes contains members displaying a high diversity in fruiting body forms. The ability of brown rotters to depolymerize cellulose and hemicellulose without removing the lignin barrier is considered a useful trait for improving the feedstock quality in biofuel production. Initial reports indicate that hydroxyl radical generation via a hydroquinone driven Fenton chemistry and secretion of low-molecular weight peptides are part of the mechanism employed by G. trabeum. The whole genome sequence of G. trabeum will be the first to represent the Gloeophyllales. It would be particularly informative to compare the genome of G. trabeum with two other sequenced brown rot species, Postia placenta and Serpula lacrymans, to elucidate the mechanisms of brown rot decay as each of them represents an independent branch of brown rot fungi. Thus, the genome of G. trabeum is expected to further research efforts in support of the DOE mission to strengthen innovative approaches in the quest for sustainable and affordable biofuel production. ; Binder M, DS Hibbett, K-H Larsson, E Larsson, E Langer and G Langer. 2005.

As in many other fungi, the hyphae are subdivided by cross walls. However, the body form of G. prolifera evolved independently from hyphae of other, more familiar fungi and G. prolifera’s true relatives are among minute, unicellular, aquatic species. Gonapodya prolifera is as distantly related to bread molds or mushrooms as humans are to jelly fish. ; Gonapodya prolifera belongs to Monoblepharidomycetes, a small class of fungi with a dauntingly long name. Like most other water molds in kingdom Fungi, asexual reproduction in the Monoblepharidomycetes involves development of zoospores inside of a sack-like sporangium. Each zoospore has a single, posterior flagellum and after escaping from the sporangium, it swims until it finds another source of food, settles and transforms into a sprawling hyphal body.  At the microscopic level, sexual reproduction in the Monoblepharidomycetes is familiar to us but highly unusual for Fungi, involving a non-motile egg that is fertilized by a swimming sperm. ; In nature, Gonapodya prolifera colonizes plant material such as twigs or decaying fruit, in oxygen-depleted water. Because of its vast genetic distance from other fungi, and because it breaks down plant material, the genome of Gonapodya prolifera almost certainly includes genes for novel enzymes. By analyzing the secreted proteins encoded in Gonapodya prolifera’s genome, it may be possible to find enzymes with useful applications in biotechnology, such as the production of biofuels.","Robert M.

This species is widespread and is easily recognized by the massive production of clusters of fruiting bodies on lawns. Gymnopus luxurians is a saprotrophic fungus growing on wood chip mulch areas and buried wood, but little is known about the decay chemistry. There is increasing evidence that at least some Gymnopus species associate with mycoheterotroph orchids. These plants have lost the ability to obtain carbon via photosynthesis in adaptation to understory growth and therefore depend on fungi as providers of alternative carbon sources. This property has usually been attributed to ectomycorrhizal fungi.

Balsamic vinegar is made by a natural fermentation of cooked grapes. As such, H. valbyensis will propagate in a stressful environment that has high sugar and acid contents and that is rich in pectins (1). H. valbyensis is known for its significant pectinolytic activity (2), which could account for its prevalence in balsamic and natural cider fermentations (3). It is also unusual in that it possesses endo-glucanase activity (4), and will tolerate relatively high levels of selenium (6). It does not produce high levels of ethanol but does form significant amounts of ethyl and phenethyl acetate (5). Its osmotolerance, acid tolerance and capacities for polysaccharide depolymerization, make it of particular biotechnological interest.

Analyses of these genomes will provide insight into the diversity of mechanisms for the mycorrhizal symbiosis, including ectomycorrhizae, ericoid- and orchid-mycorrhizae, and arbuscular mycorrhizae. ; The Basidiomycete Agaric Hebeloma cylindrosporum Romagnesi (Cortinariaceae) has only been reported to occur in Europe, from Finland or Norway in the north to Spain in the south. It is frequently found in forest stands developing on sand dunes with very little organic matter along the atlantic or mediterranean coast. In this respect, H. cylindrosporum can be qualified as a pioneer species which thrives in newly established forests or in disturbed areas. H. cylindrosporum is frequently associated with different pine trees such as Pinus pinaster. It can also form mycorrhizas with additional hosts which do not occur in its natural habitats. The most remarkable feature of H. cylindrosporum as an ectomycorrhizal fungal species is that its entire life cycle, including fruit body formation, can be obtained under axenic conditions in the laboratory using defined culture media. It can be routinely transformed using Agrobacterium tumefaciens and insertional mutant libraries are available making it possible reverse genetic approach to identify fungal functions essential for symbiosis establishment. In addition, the genomic sequence of C. puteana will contribute to a better prospect of brown rot as a fungal nutritional mode, which apparently harbors more than only one ecological strategy. ; The on-going sequencing of a phylogenetically and ecologically diverse suite of mycorrhizal fungi, which includes H. cylindroposrum, together with the major clades of symbiotic species associating with trees and woody shrubs will provide insight into the diversity of mechanisms for the mycorrhizal symbiosis. In concert with the sequencing of a suite of fungal wood decayers, these mycorrhizal genomes will also illuminate the functional basis of transitions between decayer and mutualist lifestyles. ; Reference: Marmeisse R, Guidot A, Gay G, Lambilliotte R, Sentenac H, Combier JP, Melayah D, Fraissinet-Tachet L, Debaud JC (2004) Hebeloma cylindrosporum - a model species to study ectomycorrhizal symbiosis from gene to ecosystem.

It represents the second sequenced species in the Gloeophyllales, a relatively small order containing saprotrophic mushroom-forming fungi that produce brown rot mostly on conifers, more rarely on broadleaved tree species. Species of the Gloeophyllales display a high diversity of fruiting body morphologies, with crust- or shelf-shaped and agaricoid types being most common. The Gloeophyllales represents an independent origin of agaricoid mushrooms, i.e. morphologies with with distinct cap and stipe in the Agaricomycetes. Heliocybe sulcata, the only species in its genus, produces centrally stipitate fruiting bodies with flexible, rubber-like distantly spaced gills and a deer-brown squamose, cracked cap surface. The edge of the cap often appears strongly and deeply sulcate, hence its species name. ; Heliocybe grows on unusual substrates and places, including sun-dried wood in exposed sunny places, fence posts, railroad ties, etc. Heliocybe shares the adaptation to low-humidity, exposed places with its close relative, Neolentinus lepideus, however, that species forms larger fruiting bodies with crowded, decurrent gills. Curiously, fruiting bodies of Heliocybe can revive after desiccation, which is another way for this species to combat desiccation and extremely dry habitats. By comparing the genome of Heliocybe to that of Neolentinus as well as other brown-rot Agaricomycetes, we expect to gain an insight into the evolution of their adaptation to extreme environments and the genetic bases of agaricoid mushroom production within the Gloeophyllales. ;  ",,,,Heliocybe sulcata_14_6.5

Interactions with the necrotrophic pathogen H. annosum and the model tree Populus can be compared to biotrophic interactions with rust pathogen fungi and mycorrhizal mutualists. This will increase the information on comparative genomics on fungi in general and to develop a broader view on the complex communities associated with the model tree Populus.  The sequence information will enable a comparison with the model white rotter Phanerochaete chrysosporium, deepening our understanding of wood degradation including ligninolytic and polysaccharide degradation pathways as well as for several bioremediation applications where the oxidative systems of white rotting basidiomycetes can be used to detoxify organic pollutants. ; Moreover, this project will also gain insights into fungal evolutionary history and biology including development, non self recognition, mating, and secondary metabolism. ; Recent progress in the H. annosum research include: Possibilities for fruiting and classical genetics, publication of a genetic linkage map, EST compilation of more than 3000 seqences is available, transformation system, knowledge of genetics of interspecific recognition, phylogeny of the species complex, pathogenicity factors in nucleus and mitochondria etc. This allows for a direct use of sequence information for gene discovery and functional analysis.",,,,Heterobasidion annosum_5_3.75

Petersen is a representative saprobic species that degrades buried wood in deciduous boreal forests (mainly from beech and oak trees) of temperate regions. It is characterize by its gelatinized rugose pileus and long stipe with a radicant part growing under the soil surface, forming mycelial cords to degrade dead and buried wood of stumps and roots. Based on molecular analysis (Matheny et al., 2006), this fungus is included in the Marasmioid clade and Physalacriaceae family. The latter family includes not only wood decomposers, such as Oudemansiella mucida (to be sequenced in JGI CSP-1609), but other buried-wood degraders such as the widespread edible species Flammulina velutipes (called “enoki mushrooms”) and Strobilurus esculentus, which typically degrade buried cones of Picea sp. (also to be sequenced in JGI CSP-1609). Other members of the Marasmioid clade, such as Gymnopus luxurians (Omphalotaceae family) whose genome is available at JGI, also grows on partially-degraded and buried wood. Species growing on this particular lignocellulosic substrate that is buried in soil, have been reported to cause a nonspecific type of rot (Dix and Webster, 1995). Furthermore, differences in fungal diversity between aerial and buried parts of wood were reported (Carruthers and Rayner, 1979). Colonization of aerial parts of fallen wood is mainly initiated by airborne spores of wood-decomposing Polyporales, whilst buried wood parts (that are in contact with soil), are usually colonized by mycelial cords or rhizhomorphs, more frequently found in Agaricales. A classification of different wood colonization strategies by fungi was reported (Coates and Rayner, 1985) in which a specific group was recognized including cord-forming basidiomycetes that colonize buried wood. Interestingly, differences in lignin degradation and oxidoreductases secretion patterns were reported between wood (including buried wood) and leaf litter decomposers (Liers et al., 2011). In a similar way, different oxidoreductase secretion patterns have been observed in plate cultures, which were suggested to correlate with colonization strategies of different ecophysiological groups of white rot fungi (Barrasa et al., 2014). The sequencing of H. radicata genome will improve our knowledge on the enzymatic machinery used by the ecophysiological group of fungi (Agaricales) growing on buried and partially-decayed wood, which could be useful for transformation of different types of plant biomass in lignocellulose biorefineries. ; Barrasa, J.M., Blanco, M.N., Esteve-Raventós, F., Altés, A., Checa, J., Martínez, A.T. and Ruiz-Dueñas, F.J.

It produces unique ascocarps (sexual structures), called hysterothecia, which are darkly pigmented and carbonaceous. The hysterothecium is a variable boat-like structure with a pronounced lengthwise slit to release the dark, three-septate sexual spores. Due to its seemingly transitional nature, neither fully open nor closed these fungi has been interpreted as related to very different groups throughout history.

It has been classified as a member of family Polyporaceae whose taxonomy has not yet been definitely established. Because of its interesting enzymatic systems that so far have not been investigated in detail, I. lacteus has been proposed for use in a wide spectrum of biotechnological applications: biodegradation of organic pollution, water and soil bioremediation, pretreatment of lignocellulosic substrates to improve sugar recoveries for bioethanol production, and production of industrially applicable enzymes. ; Interest in the fungus was aroused by recognizing its potential to degrade lignocellulosics. I. lacteus is able to degrade cellulose by the action of a large machinery of exocellulases and endoglucanases and, simultaneously, hemicellulose is broken down by endo-1,4-ß-xylanases and acetyl xylan esterases, and pectins by rhamnogalacturonan hydrolases. ; The significant proteolytic potential of I. lacteus was connected to pepsin-like aspartic proteases. Biotechnological applicability of the enzymes of I. lacteus was further demonstrated in the case of a commercial fibrolytic enzyme preparation and in the synthesis of chiral cyclic secondary alcohols. The secretome of I. lacteus can thus be of interest for use in pretreatment of lignocellulosic materials or for an enzymatic hydrolysis improvement through the preparation of optimized enzyme cocktails. ; I. lacteus emerged also as a species with a remarkable pollutant toxicity resistance and biodegradation capacity including some specific aromatic-ring cleavage strategies. Its application in various bioreactor cultures and in soil remediation was helped by its ability to colonize lignocellulosic materials used as the carriers on which the fungus can be immobilized. In addition, this fungus produces a new dye-decolorizing peroxidase able to display a synergistic action with cellulases during the hydrolysis of wheat straw, increasing significantly the fermentable glucose recoveries from this substrate. This extraordinary capacity is mainly the result of a high metabolic versatility and secretory potential of this fungus suggesting wide biotechnological applications.",,,,Irpex lacteus_6_2.5

The genus Jaapia consists of only two species (J. argillacea and J. ochroleuca) and has sometimes been referred to as the sister to the Boletales. More recent findings indicate that Jaapia is sister to the rest of the Agaricomycetidae, which is the largest radiation of mushroom-forming fungi including approximately 15,000 species. Jaapia argillacea lives on decaying wood of conifers and is thought to produce a type of brown rot that has not been characterized in more detail.

Members of Endogonaceae are also one of the few non-Dikarya lineages that produce “truffle-like” sporophores, making them an interesting system to explore the evolution of complex reproductive structures in fungi. All members of this family are difficult to maintain in culture. Taxa in the family Endogonaceae can host in their zygospores and mycelia Mycoplasma-related endobacteria (MRE) (Desirò et al., 2015): MRE were also detected in J. lactiflua OSC 162217 (Chang et al., under revision).

K. marxianus is frequently isolated from fermented beverages, and several studies have shown it to have a major role in flavor profiles (Morrissey, 2015). Thus, K. marxianus is an attractive platform host for biosynthesis of flavors and fragrances, in particular the important precursor ethyl acetate (Löser, 2014). A number of genome engineering tools have been developed for K. marxianus, including a CRISPR/Cas9 system (Nurcholis, 2020). Recently, the transformation competence of several K. marxianus isolates was evaluated (Cernak, 2018). K. marxianus NRRL Y-1190 (ATCC 8635, DSM 5421), had the highest transformation efficiency among the native strains tested. Thus, this strain is a promising host for future metabolic engineering and synthetic biology studies. ; The Kluyveromyces marxianus NRRL Y-1190 genome was not sequenced by the JGI. The assembly was provided by Eric Young and it was annotated using the JGI Fungal Annotation Pipeline. ; This strain was obtained from the ATCC, and was originally isolated from yogurt in West Germany. ; References: ; Gombert, A.

Analyses of these genomes will provide insight into the diversity of mechanisms for the mycorrhizal symbiosis, including endo- and ectomycorrhiza. ; The Laccaria Pan-Genome ; Laccaria Berkeley and Broome is a cosmopolitan genus of mushrooms (Agaricales) collected frequently throughout North America and Eurasia. Its taxa make up a sizeable part of the basidiomycetous ECM species and have been reported from every continent except Antarctica. Because of the relative ease with which some species of Laccaria can be manipulated in the laboratory, several taxa including L. bicolor (Maire) Orton, L. laccata (Scop.: Fr.) Cooke and L. proxima (Boud.) Pat. are widely used in applied and basic research on ECM fungi, whereas L. amethystina ecology has been investigated in many ecosystems. Therefore, evolutionary genomics of Laccaria would have applied implications because of the ecological and potential economic importance of many of its taxa in addition to adding to our basic knowledge of fungi which form symbiosis. ; To fully apply comparative, evolutionary genomics to symbiotic fungi, intragenus and population genome samples are needed. Here, we propose to resequence by Illumina GA the genome of 20 Laccaria strains including (1) three Laccaria species (L. laccata, L. proxima, L. tortilis) and (2) 17 strains of L. bicolor and L. amethystina of different geographic locations. These sequences will be mapped to the v2.0 of the reference L. bicolor genome (Martin et al., 2008). ; A population genomic analysis of L. bicolor and L. amethystina which are closely related and split from the outgroup species, L. laccata and L. proxima, several million years ago will be carried out. The vast majority of L. amethystina DNA is readily aligned to L. bicolor (Martin, unpublished results), which permits direct use of L. bicolor annotation for investigation of polymorphism and divergence and allows reliable inference of L. bicolor/L. amethystina ancestral states over much of the genome. The analysis will use the JGI reference genome v2.0 of L. bicolor, an INRA draft version of L. amethystina genome assembly (Martin, unpublished results) and a set of light-coverage, whole-genome Illumina resequencing data from 17 American, European, and Japanese strains of L. amethystina and L. bicolor. ; Such large sampling from populations in America and Eurasia will give a complete view of genomic variation in this species including vast numbers of rare variants of many different kinds (e.g. structural variants) throughout the genome. The goal here is to identify genomic regions that are candidates for selective adaptation. The main impact of this resource will be detailed annotation of the L. bicolor genome and the fostering of experimental population genomic approaches to the systematic identification of adaptations. This would allow mycologists to extract the most information about adaptive mutations that are most likely to be important to symbiosis in a well-investigated symbiotic clade.",,,,Laccaria amethystina_9_8.55

S.F. Gray, type species of Lactarius sect. Deliciosi, commonly known as the saffron milk cap and red pine mushroom, is one of the best known members of the large milk-cap genus Lactarius in the order Russulales, family Russulaceae. It has a carrot orange cap with a smooth and slightly viscid surface where darker spots and marked concentric zones often occur. The cap and the gills can turn greenish with age or when damaged. The pileus is convex with an inrolled margin and a slightly depressed center when young. It has crowded, slightly decurrent orange gills and a squat orange stipe which is often hollow.

Fr. – The Indigo Milk Cap ; Lactarius indigo is a distinctive species of Lactarius sect. Deliciosi found throughout eastern North American and Central America (Nuytinck et al. 2006). It is characterized by having a blue, zonate cap, strongly inrolled margin, blue gills, producing copious blue latex that is slightly acrid tasting, and a short blue stem (Hesler & Smith 1979). A variety of this species, Lactarius indigo var. diminutivus Hesler & A.H. Sm. is similar but has a smaller cap diameter (Hesler & Smith 1979). Lactarius indigo naturally forms ectomycorrhizal symbioses with hardwood and coniferous hosts and has been successfully synthesized with Eurasian and neotropical pines (Díaz et al. 2007). Lactarius indigo is considered a prime edible mushroom in Mexico and Central America by both local and indigenous groups (Robles-García et al. 2018). Like many species of Russulaceae, novel sesquiterpenoid compounds have been identified from L. indigo, including the azulene compound that give the mushroom its characteristic blue color (Harmon et al. 1980). This azulene compound has been used as the basis for developing fluorescent dyes to detect reactive oxygen species in cells (Murfin et al. 2019). The sporocarps for this genome were collected on October 1, 2018 in a mixed forest with mainly Pinus taeda and various species of Quercus in West Point on the Eno Park, Durham, NC. This species is a representative of a well-studied section of Lactarius that includes many popular edible mushrooms worldwide and will be important for understanding the evolution of functional diversity of Russulaceae. ; Researchers who wish to publish analyses using data from unpublished CSP genomes are respectfully required to contact the PI and JGI to avoid potential conflicts on data use and coordinate other publications with the CSP master paper(s). ; References: ; Díaz, G., Flores, R. and Honrubia, M., 2007.

The LGP is being conducted by an international consortium of seven Co-PIs and 17 Collaborators, and will eventually produce ca. 30 genome sequences derived from wild strains, as well as QTL (quantitative trait locus) and GWAS (genome-wide association study) data from cultivars. A “master” genome publication will be prepared when all 30 genomes are complete.

The LGP welcomes additional partners. ; Lentinula is a genus of white rot fungi that is best known for the edible mushroom Lentinula edodes, also called shiitake (Japanese, “oak mushroom”, <U+3057><U+3044><U+305F><U+3051>), xiang-gu (Chinese, “fragrant mushroom”, <U+9999><U+83C7>), or pyogo (Korean, <U+D45C><U+ACE0>). Historical records suggest that L. edodes was first cultivated in China about 1000 years ago, making it one of the first mushroom species to be domesticated. Today, shiitake is cultivated worldwide, and it is second only to the button mushroom, Agaricus bisporus, in terms of production volume. Shiitake breeders have developed strains that not only produce high yields, but that have enhanced growth rates and specific temperature optima for fruiting. QTL and GWAS studies that will be conducted in the LGP using cultivars will provide insight into the mechanistic bases of differences in growth performance, which is of relevance to optimizing industrial fungal bioconversions. Eight species of Lentinula are currently recognized in the taxonomic literature (five are illustrated in the figure), but two are poorly documented. Molecular data (ITS and tef1 sequences) from six of the named species resolve approximately ten distinct lineages that are widely distributed in Asia-Australasia and South, Central and North America. Sampling of wild strains in the LGP is based on lineages identified with ITS and tef1 data, with the goal of maximizing taxonomic and geographic diversity.

Meanwhile, L. edodes is the second most widely cultivated mushroom species all over the world, only second to Agaricus bisporus. As a delicious edible mushroom initially cultivated more than eight centuries ago, L. edodes possesses plenty of proteins and polysaccharides as well as unique flavor components, which render shiitake overwhelmingly popular with consumers in Asian countries such as China, Japan and Korea. It is noteworthy that the immunomodulatory activities of polysaccharides and the function on calcium supplementation from L. edodes have been verified. ;  ",http://sporeworks.com/Lentinula-edodes-Shiitake-Spore-Print.html,,,Lentinula edodes_6_3.25

The workers cut leaves then return it to their fungus garden where their cultivar L. gongylophorus enzymatically digests the plant material into usable sources of energy for the ants, which it provides to them through gongylidia, specialized hyphal swellings that the ants eat. Our aim is to compare this fungal genome to that of strains isolated from grass-cutter ant colonies (L. gongylophorus AB2) and dicot-cutter ant colonies (L. gongylophorus AS2) to determine if there is adaptation to grass vs. dicot deconstruction within this species. Since dicots and grasses differ in terms of their cell wall composition, we aim to identify genes of interest that may be responsible for the fungus' ability to break down grass and dicots, and this strain holds special interest since it represents a transitional species from dicot-specialization to grass-specialization. The identified genes can potentially be used in industrial bioenergy production for grass and dicot deconstruction.",I did not find spore data,,,Leucoagaricus gongylophorus_NA_NA

The fungus, and the other species of Linderina, L. macrospora, have been isolated from soil but are considered extremely rare. L. pennispora species produces distinctive structures during asexual sporulation forming large clusters of merosporangia borne on a single sporocladium. The merosporangia have been shown to have a slight appendage of unknown function, whose homology to the appendaged trichospore observed in the related Harpellales has been speculated (Zain et al. 2012). Sexual reproduction is unknown in the group. The mycelia, like other Kickxellomycotina, is septate with septa possessing a central pore containing a lenticular cavity occluded by an electron dense material of unknown composition. The mycelia is pigmented brightly yellow and grows well on rich nutrient agar.  Phylogenetic analyses place Linderina among Kickxellales, which is sister to the gut fungus Orphella (White et al. 2006). The genome and transcriptome of Linderina are being analyzed as part of the 1000 Fungal Genomes project.

It is known in its telomorphic form with no known anomorphic connections. L. starkeyi NCYC 1436 has been reported to have eleven chromosome-sized DNA molecules ranging from 0.7 to 2.8 kb and a total estimated genome of 15 Mb (4). Most notably from the perspective of biological energy production, L. starkeyi can form more than 60% of its cell dry weight under optimal conditions of carbon source, yeast extract and ferrous sulfate. Lipid production is maximal when glucose and xylose are supplied in a ratio of approximately 2:1 (12). L. starkeyi will produce lipids from various sugars, whey permeate (2), and even sewage sludge (3). Temperature affects lipid composition with the highest lipid production rate reported at 28°C (10, 11). Fatty acid analysis of cells grown on whey permeate showed palmitic, stearic, oleic and linoleic acid; as the predominant fatty acids in the triacylglycerol fractions. The phospholipid fractions were dominated by oleic and linoleic acids (1). L. starkeyi forms multiple alpha-amylases (6, 9), dextranase, (7), glucanohydrolase (8)and levoglucosan kinase activities, the latter of which converts this cellulolytic pyrolysate into glucose-6-phosphate (5). ; 1.

It causes seedling blight, charcoal rot, dry root rot, wilt, leaf blight, stem blight, pre- and post-emergence damping-off and root/stem rot of different cultivated and wild plant species. The fungus can remain viable for more than 4 years in soil and crop residue as sclerotia. Under favorable conditions, hyphae germinate from the sclerotia and infect the roots and/or stem of the host plant by penetrating in the plant cell wall through mechanical pressure and/or chemical softening. The disease progresses from leaf yellowing to wilting and ultimately plant death. ; The disease development is favoured with high temperature (30-35 °C) followed by moisture stress but in case of jute and corn it prefers the hot, moist and humid condition.

It is now known that M. grisea consists of a cryptic species complex containing at least two biological species that have clear genetic differences and do not interbreed. Complex members isolated from Digitaria have been more narrowly defined as M. grisea. The remaining members of the complex isolated from rice and a variety of other hosts have been renamed Magnaporthe oryzae. Confusion on which of these two names to use for the rice blast pathogen remains, as both are now used by different authors. ; Members of this complex can also infect other agriculturally important cereals including wheat, rye, barley, and pearl millet causing diseases called blast disease or blight disease. Rice blast causes economically significant crop losses annually. Each year it is estimated to destroy enough rice to feed more than 60 million people. The fungus is known to occur in 85 countries worldwide. ; Like many foliar plant pathogens, M. oryzae is well adapted to attack and penetrate its host. All aerial parts of the plant are subject to invasion, but losses are most devastating when the panicle or node at the base of the panicle is infested and killed resulting in loss of grain set. The pathogen infects as a spore that produces lesions or spots on parts of the rice plant such as the leaf, leaf collar, panicle, culm and culm nodes. Using a structure called an appressorium, the pathogen penetrates the plant. The pathogen is able to move between the plant cells using its invasive hyphae to enter through plasmodesmata. M. grisea then sporulates from the diseased rice tissue to be dispersed as conidiospores. After overwintering in sources such as rice straw and stubble, the cycle repeats. A single cycle can be completed in about a week under favorable conditions where one lesion can generate up to thousands of spores in a single night. Disease lesions, however, can appear in three to four days after infection. With the ability to continue to produce the spores for over 20 days, rice blast lesions can be devastating to susceptible rice crops. ; Management of rice blast disease is most precarious. While in the past, control was mainly through use of expensive and potentially hazardous chemicals (when affordable) the focus has shifted, as it has for most diseases, to more environmentally friendly and potentially less expensive approaches, principally mediated through host resistance. The rice blast genome appears to be quite unstable and in some instances new races appear relatively quickly. A key to developing effective and durable resistance is through a comprehensive understanding of the host-pathogen interaction, which in turn requires a thorough understanding of both the host and the pathogen. ; Magnaporthe oryzae is an excellent model organism for studying fungal phytopathogenicity and host-parasite interactions. M. oryzae is a haploid, filamentous Ascomycete with a relatively small genome of ~40 Mb contained in 7 chromosomes. The majority of fungal pathogens belong to this taxonomic class or exist as related asexual forms. M. oryzae is also closely related to the non-pathogen Neurospora crassa, a leading model organism for the study of eukaryotic genetics and biology. Unlike many phytopathogenic fungi such as mildews and rusts, the rice blast fungus can be cultured on defined media, facilitating biochemical and molecular analyses. Significantly, early stages of the infection process including germination, appressorium formation and penetration can be studied ex-planta.",http://www.indexfungorum.org/Names/NamesRecord.asp?RecordID=224486,,,Magnaporthe oryzae_21_11

Meira geulakonigii has been the subject of biocontrol experiments where it has been demonstrated to have a toxic effect on several mite species (Sztejnberg et al., 2004; Gerson et al., 2005) and an inhibitory effect on powdery mildew disease (Paz et al., 2007a; Gerson et al., 2008). Members of the genus Meira have also been recovered as an endophytes in various plants tissues (Yasuda et al., 2006; Paz et al., 2007b; Vega et al., 2010). ; The type strain of M. miltonrushii (CBS12591) was selected for genome sequencing. In culture, M. miltonrushii forms light brown, cerebriform colonies on potato dextrose agar (PDA). The colonies consist of yeast cells with polar budding. Despite being morphologically similar to the anamorphic “smut” (subphylum Ustilaginomycotina) genus Pseudozyma, phylogenetic analyses of several rDNA loci show that the genus belongs to Brachybasidiaceae, Exobasidiales (Exobasidiomycetes, Ustilaginomycotina) (Rush and Aime, 2013). Whether M. miltonrushii possesses a sexual state remains unknown. ; The genome sequence of M. miltonrushii will provide the first whole genome reference sequence for a member of Brachybasidiaceae. Researchers will use these data in phylogenetic and phylogenomic reconstructions and in comparative genomics studies that seek to elucidate the molecular bases governing production of sexual and anamorphic states, invertebrate toxins, and the evolution of phytopathogenicity in Ustilaginomycotina ;  ;   ;   ;    ; References: ;   ; Boekhout T, Theelen B, Houbraken J, Robert V, Scorozetti G, Gafni A, Gerson U, Sztejnberg A. 2003.

The fungus has been developed and applied as a promising insect biological control agent against different insect pests. The sexual stage of Metarhizium spp. is recognized as Metacordyceps spp. but the fungus is largely clonally reproduced in the field. The haploid of M. robertsii contains a single mating-type locus and the fungus is thereby sexually heterothallic. The fungus infects insects by producing appressoria to penetrate insect cuticles and then colonize insect hemocoels. It has been recently evident that the fungus can also colonize plant roots where it may simultaneously act as a biofertilizer and biopesticide to boost plant growth. The fungus is also a prolific producer of diverse secondary metabolites with activities against insects, fungi, bacteria and cancer cells. Metarhizium robertsii is not randomly distributed in soils but preferentially associates with the plant rhizosphere when applied in agricultural settings.",According to the description it is morphologically undistinguishable from ansiopiale.

The strain of M. bolleyi sequenced for the 1000 Fungal Genome Project was found growing within roots of three species of beachgrass along the USA Pacific Northwest Coast: the native Elymus mollis and the invasive Ammophila arenaria and A. breviligulata. The particular isolate (J235TASD1) sequenced was isolated from A. breviligulata. In a survey of beachgrass endophytes, M. bolleyi was the most frequently isolated endophyte (David et al. 2015a). M. bolleyi was also the fastest growing and one of the highest conidia-producing endophyte species in culture (David et al. 2015a). ; While the effects of M. bolleyi on its beachgrass hosts has not yet been quantified, M. bolleyi is typically regarded as a commensal or weak pathogen (Kirk and Deacon 1987). ; This particular strain of M. bolleyi is important for our understanding of how fungi tolerate extreme environments. Dune systems are characterized by high winds, low soil moisture, and low soil nutrients (Cooper 1958, David et al. 2015b), making them harsh environments for most organisms. Studying the genomes of species that thrive in these habitats may reveal how these species evolved traits for tolerating these environments. ;   ; References: ;  ",,,,Microdochium bolleyi_7_1.9

Kramer is the sole species in one of the more enigmatic genera of Fungi.  It is an intracellular parasite of ferns in the genus Osmunda where it forms multinucleate hyphae that are rarely septate (Bauer et al. 2006).  On the surface of host epidermal cells it forms small oblong sporangia (24-60 x 9-25 µm).  Thousands of minute spores (3-4.5 x 1.5-2.5 µm) are produced on the surface of sporangia in a simultaneous fashion that is unlike any other known method of spore production in Fungi.  It is unknown if the spores are produced through sexual or asexual reproduction and the complete life cycle is not fully elucidated.  Mixia can be pure-cultured and grows in a budding, yeast-like form under these conditions.    The phylogenetic placement of Mixia has long been problematic.  It was originally considered a member of Taphrinales of the early diverging Ascomycota (Mix 1947, Kramer 1958), but only recently has it been determined that it is a member of the Pucciniomycotina, a subphylum of Basidiomycota that includes rust fungi (Nishida et al., 1995).  Multigene molecular phylogenies support it as a phylogenetically distinct lineage among the Pucciniomycotina and it is currently classified as the sole member of the class Mixiomycetes (Aime et al. 2006). ; At 13.6Mb, M. osmundae has the smallest plant pathogenic basidiomycete genome sequenced to date. The genome structure differs from almost all other sequenced basidiomycetes in having high gene density and almost no repetitive regions. Genome analysis indicates that the spores and yeast state in culture are haploid and likely produced asexually although the possession of a full set of mating and meiosis genes indicates that sexual reproduction may occur in some as yet unobserved part of the life cycle of M. osmundae. A study of carbohydrate active enzymes shows that M. osmundae possesses enzyme sets characteristic of biotrophic fungi (Toome et al. 2013). ;   ; Other references ; Aime et al.  2006.  An overview of the higher level classification of Pucciniomycotina based on combined analyses of nuclear large and small subunit rDNA sequences.  Mycologia 98: 896-905.

Phylogenetically, M. roreri is related to another fungal pathogen, Moniliophthora perniciosa (Stahel) Aime and Phillips-Mora, which causes Witches’ Broom Disease, a disease that infects all cacao meristematic tissues including flowers, shoots, and pods. Together, these pathogens cause two of the most economically important diseases of Theobroma cacao in the Western Hemisphere. While both of these fungal species are pathogenic on the plant genera Theobroma and Herrania, M. roreri is not known to have any other hosts, whereas M. perniciosa has distinct biotypes that infect different host species. Historically, these Moniliophthora pathogens have spread independently to cacao producing areas across the Western Hemisphere and they have typically resulted in production losses of 75% or higher in nearly all the cacao growing regions in the Americas. ;  ",,,,Moniliophthora roreri_9.5_8.5

Members of this class are obligate anaerobes, lack mitochondria (harboring hydrogenosomes instead), and reproduce asexually through the production of flagellated zoospores. Their life cycle resembles that of the members of the Chytridiomycota phylum. Gut fungi (Neocallimastigomycetes) are members of the gut microbial community within large herbivores, such as ruminants and hindgut fermenters, where they are the primary microbes to colonize plant material and initiate its degradation. Gut fungi can be isolated from the feces of these animals and sustained in anaerobic lab cultures where they are capable of degrading biomass without pretreatment (Haitjema et al., 2014), and are of key biotechnology interest due to the biomass-degrading enzymes that they produce.Neocallimastix californiae G1 was isolated from the feces of a goat at the Santa Barabara Zoo. This fungal isolate is of particular interest for both fungal evolutionary and application based studies. The genome will aid in the discovery of novel biomass degrading enzymes that may be engineered or heterologously expressed for the production of lignocellulosic biofuels and other value added chemicals. Furthermore, the genomes will enable future –OMICs based characterization of these organisms, including insight into their unique organelles and biomass-degrading enzyme complexes.References  Haitjema CH, Solomon KV, Henske JK, Theodorou MK, O’Malley MA. 2014.

We are sequencing the genome of the most abundant fungal species harvested on studied sites to serve as the foundation for a reference database for metagenomics of fungi and for a comprehensive survey of the potential soil fungal metabolome. ; Neolentinus lepideus ; This is a worldwide distributed species belonging to the small order Gloeophyllales. The Gloeophyllales includes brown-rot species with tough, corky fruiting bodies. However, the morphology of fruiting bodies is very diverse, including resupinate, polyporoid and agaricoid species. N. lepideus belongs to the latter category, with well-delimited stipe, cap and lamellae and represents an independent acquisition of the agaricoid fruiting body type. Fruiting bodies show high levels of convergence in mushrooms. The agaricoid type only has evolved several times in distantly related orders, such as the Agaricales, Boletales, Russulales, Hymenochaetales and the Gloeophyllales. Of these, the Gloeophyllales is one of the most ancient order where agaricoid species evolved, which makes it a very useful source of information for understanding the evolution of fruiting body plans in mushrooms. ; Furthermore, the genome of N. lepideus has an important contribution to deciphering the phylogenetic position of Agaricomycete orders. The position of the Gloeophyllales on the phylogenetic tree of the Agaricomycetes has been unresolved based on previous multi gene phylogenies. By analyzing a genome-wide set of genes from this and other taxa, we expect to gain a strongly supported phylogenetic placement for the Gloeophyllales. ; The common name of this species is Train Wrecker, which refers to its ability to grow on railroad ties. It can also grow on timber in mines, including chemically preserved woody material. Regarding wood-rot type, Neolentinus belongs to the brown-rotters, i.e. it attacks only cellulose in the wood. The type of rot was the basis for the taxonomic separation of Neolentinus from Lentinus, since the latter is a white-rot group in the Polyporales. Because of its position on the phylogenetic tree of the Agaricomycotina, Neolentinus is critical to recovering the evolution of the wood-decay apparatus and contributes to the resolution of several ambiguities about the origin and expansion of lignocellulose decaying gene families. ;  ",,,,Neolentinus lepideus_13.5_10.5

It belongs to the Polyporales, and is closely related with Gelatoporia subvermispora (= Ceriporiopsis subvermispora). The species is widespread in the temperate zone of the Northern Hemisphere, but it is rare throughout most of its range. It causes white rot on fallen logs of conifers and has been repeatedly collected on burned wood. The North American and European populations of this species show slight genetic variation (Miettinen & Rajchenberg 2012).

Methods of classic and molecular genetics are well developed for this species [4, 5]. ; O. polymorpha is a popular system for basic research, i.e. studying methanol metabolism, peroxisome biogenesis and degradation, biochemistry of nitrate assimilation, resistance to heavy metals and oxidative stress, as well as production of recombinant proteins that include commercially available pharmaceuticals [2, 5]. ; Furthermore, O. polymorpha is a thermo-tolerant microorganism with some strains growing at temperatures up to 50°C and more. The O. polymorpha strain NCYC 495 leu1.1 is capable of fermenting xylose, cellobiose and glucose to ethanol at high temperatures (45° - 50° C) [6,7]. This is so far the maximal known temperature for yeast growth and eukaryotic alcoholic fermentation. Despite the fact that ethanol yield from xylose of engineered O. polymorpha strain still is rather low, the yeast defines it as a good candidate for use in efficient process of simultaneous saccharification and fermentation. ; References ; 1.Gellissen, G.

O. maius can be easily grown in vitro, where it reproduces asexually by forming conidia with a single haploid nucleus, that can germinate and produce a homokaryotic mycelium. Agrobacterium-mediated transformation (AMT) and protoplast transformation have been recently used to obtain random and GFP O. maius mutants. Moreover, it was O. maius itself the first mycorrhizal fungus in which a gene-targeted disruption via homologous recombination was realized. These tools would allow us to develop a powerful post-genomics activity. O. maius is an interesting experimental organism being both an endomycorrhizal fungus (with ericaceous plants, e.g. Vaccinium myrtillus, Calluna vulgaris), and a metal-tolerant fungus. The metal tolerance is particularly evident for strains isolated from the roots of V. myrtillus growing on heavy metal-polluted soils; these strains were demonstrated to tolerate metal concentrations that cause a complete growth inhibition of isolates coming from unpolluted soils. Moreover, there is evidence that this fungus has weathering capacities, as it can modify asbestos fibres. O. maius genome sequencing will allow us to make considerable advances in our understanding of the genetic and functional basis of the ericoid symbiosis, still poorly studied. Moreover, a sequencing project would be highly beneficial in our on-going efforts to study O. maius metal resistance mechanisms and to envisage its possible use in bioremediation projects. In fact the genome sequence could facilitate a rapid identification of the genes underlying the extremely high tolerance observed for this fungus.",,,,Oidiodendron maius_2.8_1.8

It mainly found in the meadows above 3,500 meters (11,483 feet) in the Himalayan regions of Nepal, Bhutan, India and Tibet. It parasitizes larvae of ghost moths and produces a fruiting body which used to be valued as a herbal remedy. However, the fruiting bodies harvested in nature usually contain high amounts of arsenic and other heavy metals so they are potentially toxic and sales have been strictly regulated by the CFDA (China Food and Drug Administration) in 2016. O. sinensis parasitizes the larvae of moths within the family Hepialidae; specifically genera from the Tibetan Plateau, and the Himalayas that are found between 3-5000m ASL. The fungus germinates in the living larva, kills and mummifies it, and then a dark brown stalk-like fruiting body which is a few centimeters long emerges from the corpse and stands upright. It is known in English colloquially as caterpillar fungus, or by its more prominent names yartsa gunbu (""winter worm, summer grass""), or dong chóng xià cao. O. sinensis is classified as a medicinal mushroom, and its use has a long history in traditional Chinese medicine as well as traditional Tibetan medicine. The hand-collected, intact fungus-caterpillar body is valued by herbalists as medicine, and because of its cost, its use is also a status symbol. This fruiting bodies of the fungus are not yet cultivated commercially, but the mycelium form can be cultivated in vitro. Overharvesting and overexploitation have led to the classification of O. sinensis as an endangered species in China. Additional research needs to be carried out in order to understand its morphology and growth habits for conservation and optimum utilization.",What is the Chinese caterpillar fungus Ophiocordyceps sinensis (Ophiocordycipitaceae)?,,,Ophiocordyceps sinensis_160_4.75

P. tannophilus produces ethanol only slowly from xylose, but it proceeds under completely anaerobic conditions with the concomitant production of significant amounts of xylitol and some acetic acid. It uses nitrate as a nitrogen source, which stimulates the aerobic production of ethanol from xylose while blocking anaerobic xylose metabolism (2). Its xylose reductase (1) and xylulokinase  activities are induced and hexokinase rapidly inactivated (8) when cells are cultivated on xylose (4).

In order to allow comparative analyses with other fungal genomes sequenced by the JGI, a copy of this genome is incorporated into Mycocosm. ; Paracoccidioides brasiliensis is a dimorphic fungus and the causative agent of the disease paracoccidioidomycosis. Being a dimorphic fungus, it has the ability to grow an oval yeast-like form at 37°C and an elongated mycelial form produced at room temperature. The mycelial and yeast phases differ in their morphology, biochemistry, and ultrastructure. The yeast form contains large amounts of a-(1,3)-linked glucan. The chitin content of the mycelial form is greater than that of the yeast form, but the lipid content of both phases is comparable.  Although the habitat of P. brasiliensis remains unknown, it is commonly associated with soils in which coffee is cultivated. The disease caused by P. brasiliensis is mostly geographically restricted to Latin American countries such as Brazil, Colombia, and Venezuela, with the greatest number of cases seen in Brazil. The endemic areas are characterized by hot, humid summers, dry temperate winters, average annual temperatures between 17 and 23°C, and annual rainfall between 500 and 800 mm. However, the precise ecology regularities of the fungus remain elusive, and P. brasiliensis has rarely been encountered in nature outside the human host.  Paracoccidioidomycosis is characterized by slow, progressive granulomatous changes in the head mucosa, notably the nose and sinuses or the skin. Uncommonly, the disease affects the lymphatic system, the central nervous system, the gastrointestinal tract, or the skeletal system. Due to the high proportion of cases affecting the oral mucosa, these tissues were originally thought to be the primary route of entry of fungus.

P. parasitica grows well in axenic culture on ordinary fungal culture media (Schipper 1978). When parasitizing a suitable host (a mucoralean fungus of the opposite mating type), P. parasitica produces narrow hyphae that form septa to delineate the region behind the regions of contact. These contact areas enlarge and the wall between them dissolves, those of the host forming fingerlike growths and the apex of the parasite mycelium becomes globose; the nuclei of the both the host and parasite mix (Schipper 1978). The parasitism of P. parasitica is dependent on the mating type of the host, P. parasitica (+) will parasitize only Absidia glauca (-) or any other suceptable species of the Mucoraceae that is of the (-) mating type. Zygospore formation in Parasitella requires the presence of the appropriate host because because trisporic acid levels are low in P. parasitica (Wöstemeyer et al. 1995).  Genome sequence for this lineage provides additional understanding of the phylogenetic diversity of the Mucoralean fungi and sampling of major Families within the order.

More than half of this carbon is found in soil organic matter (SOM). Recent studies have indicated that ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungi provide the dominant pathway through which carbon enters the SOM pool. The same fungi also drive the cycling of other nutrients within the forest community (microbiome) together with other soil microorganisms. Global climate changes as well as increasing anthropogenic nitrogen deposition are compelling reasons to study in detail how EM fungi and associated microflora mediate carbon as well as nitrogen cycling and deposition in terrestrial ecosystems. Likewise, EM fungi are known to protect plants from toxic metals. So, the development of metal-tolerant fungal associations would provide a strategy for active remediation of metal-contaminated soils. ; Paxillus involutus is one of the most well studied EM fungi at molecular, physiological, and ecological levels. The fungus forms mycorrhizae (mutually beneficial root systems) with many species of trees, including the genetic model tree species Populus trichocarpa. Comparative analyses of the genome and transcriptome of P. involutus with those of the recently sequenced EM fungus Laccaria bicolor can reveal the evolutionary processes that led to the diversification of EM fungi, and the mechanistic bases of transitions between decomposer and mycorrhizal lifestyles. The complete genome sequence of P. involutus will facilitate studies aiming at identifying the genomic mechanisms that could account for the variations in phenotypic characteristics and adaptations in EM fungi to specific hosts and environments. The P. involutus genome sequence will help to identify the molecular mechanisms controlling the development and function of rhizomorphs (tough root-like structures that facilitate colonization of large areas of soil and serve as a significant repository for carbon storage) by soil fungi. P. involutus has also been one of the most commonly studied fungi for examining the mechanisms of toxic metal tolerance and excess salinity. The Paxillus genome sequence will allow the annotation of genes coding proteins such as transporters involved in metal uptake and proteins involved in metal homeostasis and free radical scavenging. Based on the genome sequences of P. involutus, L. bicolor and P. trichocarpa, it will be possible to construct a gene chip that would allow in-depth exploration of the poplar microbiome, thus adding a needed dimension to climate change research and providing another step in the quest for mechanistic modelling of ecosystem responses.",,,,Paxillus involutus_9_5.8

They are related to the Aspergilli that also include several important industrial species. Comparative analysis of Aspergilli and Penicillia is likely to reveal evolutionary changes in fungal biology, in particular related to carbon/biomass utilization, production of secondary metabolites (e.g. antibiotics) and the regulatory systems driving these processes. ; ",,,,Penicillium chrysogenum_3_3.15

Fungi, which are particularly adapted to a saprophytic lifestyle, are among the main biological agents causing crop deterioration during transport and storage. In citrus, a common postharvest disease known as green mold and caused by Penicillium digitatum can account for up to 90% of the total losses, especially in arid and sub-tropical climates ; P. digitatum is a necrotrophic wound pathogen that requires pre-existing injured fruit peel to penetrate the plant tissue, and it colonizes mostly through the deployment of maceration enzymes. Remarkably, and despite this rather unspecific infection mechanism, P. digitatum exhibits a high degree of host specificity and has not been described as 'naturally-occurring' in other pathosystems outside citrus fruits. ;   ;   ;   ;   ;   ;   ;   ;   ;  ",,,,Penicillium digitatum_32.515625_31.46875

Pleosporales contains several plant symbiotic taxa, among them several lineages of root endophytes. According to our present knowledge Periconia macrospinosa is a ""dark septate endophytic"" (DSE) fungus. DSE fungi are found worldwide and comprise a group of root-colonizing endophytes that belong to several ascomycete orders. Periconia macrospinosa is one of the most frequent, common and general members of the DSE community of semiarid grasslands; the fungus shows a kind of tendency to grass hosts. The DSE fungi seem to have important role in stressful environments and are frequent in semiarid ecosystems like e.g. the sandy grasslands representing the westernmost parts of the Eurasian steppe-belt (the original locality of the strain P. macrospinosa sp. DSE2036) and the prairie ecosystems of North America. The role of the DSE fungi in the ecosystem functioning is still elusive; their interaction with plants is not as well understood as that of the common mycorrhizae. Moreover, DSE fungi colonize nonmycorrhizal plants, like e.g. the members of mustard family including rapeseed an important biodiesel fuel. Periconia macrospinosa strains are used in symbiotic experiments with Arabidopsis thaliana. We may assume that DSE fungi represent a special plant-fungus interaction and their comparison with other symbiotic fungi might help us to understand better carbon cycling and ecosystem functioning.",,,,Periconia macrospinosa_26.5_26.5

Accordingly, harnessing the metabolic potential of these organisms will be key to developing cost-effective technologies for the production of renewable energy and value-added co-products from residual plant biomass. ; The aim of the current initiative is to sequence the genome of the softwood-degrading, white-rot basidiomycete, Phanerochaete carnosa. While other white-rot species, including the model P. chrysosporium, have been mainly isolated from hardwoods, the majority of P. carnosa strains have been isolated from coniferous trees including Abies balsamea, Abies concolor, and Pinus ponderosa. Softwood and hardwood fiber differ in the structure and composition of their hemicellulosic polymers and lignin. For instance, glucuronoxylan comprises approximately 20-30 % of the secondary cell wall polysaccharides in hardwood, while galactoglucomannan is the main hemicellulose in secondary cell walls of softwood. Furthermore, softwoods contain mainly guaiacyl lignin, whereas hardwoods contain varying ratios of guaiacyl-syringyl lignins. Given its ability to efficiently grow on softwood substrates, it is anticipated that P. carnosa encodes enzymes that are comparatively proficient at processing this recalcitrant feedstock. The genome sequences from other basidiomycetous fungi will provide an important resource for comparative genomic analyses and construction of robust catabolic models to predict necessary activities for white-rot conversion of softwood fiber. Enzymes identified through these analyses are expected to be particularly important for bioproduct industries in Northern countries, where softwood constitutes a major portion of the available biomass. ;  ",,,,Phanerochaete carnosa_4.875_2.375

A large collaborative effort led by PI of this project, David Hibbett (Clark University) aims for master publication(s) of the SAP data analysis. Researchers who wish to publish analyses using data from unpublished SAP genomes are respectfully required to contact the PI and JGI to avoid potential conflicts on data use and coordinate other publications with the SAP master paper(s). ; Phlebiopsis gigantea is a basidiomycete belonging to a small group of microbes that are uniquely able to efficiently depolymerize, degrade, and mineralize lignin. Collectively referred to as white rot fungi, most are saprophytes that readily colonize hardwood substrates. Well-known examples previously sequenced by the Joint Genome Institute include Phanerochaete chrysosporium and Ceriporiopsis subvermispora. Although closely related to these species, the white rot fungus P. gigantea is distinct in its ability to rapidly colonize the freshly cut sapwood of conifers. The mechanisms by which this fungus degrades cell walls and the resinous components in conifer wood are poorly understood. This unusual capability has led to the development of P. gigantea as a biocontrol agent against subsequent colonization by the root rot pathogen Heterobasidium annosum and by blue stain fungi. Little is known about the mechanism(s) by which white rot fungi degrade conifer extractives, but it is expected that comparative genome analyses of P. gigantea and closely related Polyporales such as P. chrysosporium, C. subvermispora and P. carnosa will advance our understanding of the complex hydrolytic and oxidative mechanisms involved in plant cell wall deconstruction, especially of conifer wood. Ultimately, these results may provide new strategies and enzymes that enable the efficient conversion of coniferous feedstocks to high value, small molecular weight products for the further development of bioenergy/biofuels processes.",,,,Phlebiopsis gigantea_6.125_3.008928571

Quél., commonly known as “king trumpet mushroom” is an edible fungus living saprobic or weakly parasitic on roots of herbaceous Apiaceae family plants (such as Eryngium campestre), at the contrary to other Pleurotus species such as Pleurotus ostreatus (the ""oyster mushroom”), which is a white-rot wood decay fungus. P. eryngii is characterized by its cream to ochraceous brown, flabelliform to deeply depressed pileus and decurrent (sometimes anastomosing) gills and excentric to lateral (rarely central) stipe. The family Pleurotaceae belongs to the pluteoid clade of the order Agaricales (Matheny et al., 2006). P. eryngii is widely distributed in Mediterranean and central areas of Europe, some parts of west Asia and North Africa (Hilber, 1997). Due to mild taste and pleasant odor P. eryngii is of commercial interest. Moreover, mycelium is frequently cultivated on lignocellulosic wastes (such as wheat straw), and fruit bodies are and commercialized throughout the world. ; Interestingly, P. eryngii is able to degrade lignin selectively when growing on nonwoody lignocellulosic materials (as described for Ceriporiopsis subvermispora when growing on wood) being of biotechnological interest for biopulping (Camarero et al., 1998) and other delignification applications (such as bioethanol production). Versatile peroxidase (representing the third ligninolytic peroxidase family) and aryl-alcohol oxidase (an enzyme providing hydrogen peroxide to peroxidases) were discovered in this fungus (Camarero et al. 1999; Guillén et al., 1992; Ruiz-Dueñas et al. 1999) and then largely characterized. The comparative genomic analysis of P. eryngii (an herbaceous plant litter decay fungus) with the wood decay P. ostreatus (already sequenced by JGI), will provide the opportunity to compare the lignocellulolytic enzymatic machinery of two closely taxonomically related species with different lifestyles (and selective vs simultaneous lignin degradation patterns). ; Camarero, S., Barrasa, J.M., Pelayo, M., and Martínez, A.T.

A large collaborative effort led by PI of this project, David Hibbett (Clark University) aims for master publication(s) of the SAP data analysis. Researchers who wish to publish analyses using data from unpublished SAP genomes are respectfully required to contact the PI and JGI to avoid potential conflicts on data use and coordinate other publications with the SAP master paper(s). ; Plicaturopsis crispa produces clusters of small, fan-shaped fruiting bodies with wrinkled spore bearing layers that resemble vein-like folds. There is a general notion that this fungus has been expanding its original southern range over the last few decades with temperatures increasing globally. Plicaturopsis crispa is an effective decayer in the initial phase of decay colonizing predominantly dead branches of deciduous trees (Fagus and Betula) and is associated with a white rot. After a couple of years into the succession of wood degradation, strong competitors such as Trametes versicolor and the split-gill fungus Schizophyllum commune displace P. crispa cumulatively. The Amylocorticiales, the group containing P. crispa, is a recently described order of Agaricomycetes including mostly resupinate fungi with saprotrophic and sometimes biotrophic lifestyles. In addition, the Amylocorticiales including roughly 70 species is sister to the Agaricales (13,000 species). The genome of P. crispa will be the first to represent the Amylocorticiales. The characterization of the Plicaturopsis genome will be crucial for comparative studies concerning the evolution of decay strategies in both the Amylocorticiales and Agaricales, adding to the larger picture of identifying the essential enzymatic mechanisms that are needed to function successfully as a white-rot fungus.",,,,Plicaturopsis crispa_3.75_1.1

The genus Pluteus is a member of the Agaricales, the largest order of mushroom-forming fungi with some 14000 described species. Within the order, Pluteus is closely related to Volvariella, which contains the widely produced edible straw mushroom (Volvariella volvacea). Pluteus cervinus (deer mushroom) is widely distributed in the northern hemisphere, found growing on decaying trunks or wood buried in the soil. The species is believed to be a saprotroph, usually found associated with white-rotted decaying wood. However, unlike Pluteus spp., white rot fungi can usually be easily cultured on microbiological media, suggesting a more specialized nutritional mode for this genus. The genome sequence of Pluteus cervinus might shed light on the nutritional status of species in this genus. ; The sequencing project for Pluteus involved the purification of DNA and RNA from field-collected fruiting bodies, which was necessary because species Pluteus are generally considered unculturable, with only one report of successful cultivation so far (Banerjee, Mycologist 8(3): 132-135, 1994). Although such projects have a risk of contamination by bacteria and other inhabitants of fruiting bodies (e.g. insects), in the case of Pluteus cervinus, bacterial contamination remained very low (<1%) in the assembled genome. The successful completion of the genome shows that fruiting body-based genomics is feasible for species that cannot be cultured under laboratory conditions and can provide window into the unculturable microbial diversity of forest ecosystems.",,,,Pluteus cervinus_7.271052632_5.307894737

All of these morphologies aim to increase the useful surface for spore production, which helps in the dispersal of the fungus. P. arcularius has a pored hymenophore, but the pores are wide, resembling a transitional stage between gilled and pored surfaces, where single gills are anastomosing to give a pored appearance. Indeed, P. arcularius is closely related to the gilled genus Lentinus, with which it shares the production of a pileus (cap) on a centrally attached stipe (stalk). Another group of “gilled polypores” is the genus Panus, including P. rudis, which has also had a complete genome sequence produced at the JGI.

This isolate of the species, formerly known as Entophlyctis confervae-glomeratae, was cultured by Donald J. S. Barr from pine pollen baiting of a flower bed soil sample from the Central Experimental Farm, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada in 1970. Until that time, the majority of Entophlyctis species had been described from fungi that were parasites on green algae. Barr used isolate Barr81 as one of the subjects of an extensive examination of physiological requirements and preferences conducive to the culturing of E. confervae-glomeratae. In 1980, Barr segregated a portion of the Chytridiales into the Spizellomycetales, which possessed a unique suite of zoosporic ultrastructural characters. Based on ultrastructurally-examined species available at the time, and that had been collected from soil substrates, Entophlyctis, including E. confervae-glomeratae, was placed within the Spizellomycetales. In 1995, Joyce E. Longcore described a new species of Entophlyctis from a sample of aquatic plant matter, but this new species possessed zoosporic ultrastructural characters indicative of the Chytridiales. Longcore subsequently returned the algal-associated Entophlyctis species, and the genus itself, back into the Chytridiales. Thus, Entophlyctis-like species from soil and with Spizellomycetales ultrastructure, including E. confervae-glomeratae, were reclassified into the new genus Powellomyces, named after chytrid researcher Martha J. Powell, in honor of her work on the ultrastructural features of this newly-reclassified group and additional chytrid taxa. Powellomyces hirtus is now the monotypic species of the genus, which has been further reclassified based on additional ultrastructural and phylogenetic study. The wealth of information on P. hirtus Barr81, the isolate’s continued viability, and its relative ease of culturing makes this a valuable research organism.","Barr, D.J.S. 1971.

The fungus forms cream to tan, butyrous colonies with a smooth margin. The colonies consist of subglobose to ellipsoidal yeasts with multipolar budding. Based on rDNA sequence analyses, the isolate is closely related to the non-pathogenic anamorphic yeast species Rhodotorula hinnulea and R. phylloplana which are currently placed in Microstromatales (Shivas and Rodrigues de Miranda, 1983; Weijman et al., 1988; Begerow et al., 2014). Assimilation studies in addition to DNA analyses suggest that the isolate MCA4718 represents an unpublished species, now named Pseudomicrostroma glucosiphilum gen et sp. nov (Kijpornyongpan and Aime, 2017). ; Previous studies have shown that most pink-pigmented yeasts currently described as Rhodotorula species belong to the Microbotryomycetes and Cystobasidiomycetes in Pucciniomycotina, with the type species belonging in Microbotryomycetes (summarized in Aime et al., 2006, 2014). Thus, a new genus will need to be created for those species currently residing in Microstromatales, including the new species selected for genome sequencing. ; The genome sequence of Pseudomicrostroma glucosiphilum gen et sp. nov will provide a genome reference sequence for a member of Microstromatales.

The genus Pterula is a member of the Agaricales, the largest order of mushroom-forming fungi with some 14000 described species. It is a small genus, with ca. 50 species world-wide, however, it represents an important milestone in the evolution of complex morphologies in mushroom-forming fungi. Pterula spp. produce simple whitish coral- or hair-like fruiting bodies. Some species are unbranched, simple filiform while others have dichotomously branched fruiting bodies that can reach several centimeters in diameter. They belong to a small family (Pterulaceae) that contains some 14 genera of crust- or coral-like fungi. Crust- and coral-like fruiting bodies represent a plesiomorphic condition in the Agaricales: the genomic data produced for this species during this project will help understanding the origins of more derived mushroom morphologies in the Agaricales. It has been hypothesized that coralloid morphologies represent a transitional state toward the evolution of gilled mushrooms. ",CONTRIBUCIÓN AL ESTUDIO DE LA DIVERSIDAD FÚNGICAANDALUZA II,,,Pterula gracilis_9.5_6

R. globosum strain JEL800 was isolated from purified shrimp chitin bait added to a raw collection of Sphagnum, debris and water collected from fen vegetation (mixed Sphagnum, sedges, Vaccinium macrocarpon) at the edge of Perch Pond (previously known as Mud Pond), a lake in Old Town, Maine.  This fungus tends to have an apical discharge papilla whereas Rhizoclosmatium globosum H.E.Petersen (1909) is described as, at least sometimes, having a lateral discharge papilla. Spherical, chitinophilic members of the Chytriomycetaceae family are commonly isolated and much undescribed diversity probably resides within the group.  This organism has a ~20 hr generation time at 23 C, which is significantly faster than the multiple days it takes for development in most other chytrid fungi. The rapidity of development and the tractable size of the sporangia and zoospore cells as compared to many other Chytridiomycota fungi, make it an ideal experimental study organism for chytrid biology and processes such as flagellar biosynthesis. ; References  James T.

Please note that this copy of the genome is not maintained by the author and is therefore not automatically updated. ; The fungus Rhizoctonia solani (teleomorph Thanatephorus cucumeris) is responsible for many economically important plant diseases worldwide (Sneh et al., 1996). Donk (1956) initially proposed to designate the genus Thanatephorus as the teleomorphic phases of the R. solani multinucleate anamorph. It is generally accepted that the genus applies to most parasitic fungi like R. solani considered as a very destructive plant pathogen (González-Garcia et al., 2006). R. solani is a species complex of genetically distinct fungi groups in the cantherelloid clade of the phylum Basidiomycota (Binder et al., 2005). ; As a fundamentally asexual fungus the anamorph R. solani does not reproduce sexually (Adams, 1996). The pathogen survives and disseminates in form of sclerotia and/or vegetative mycelia (Keijer et al., 1996). However, Rhizoctonia species are strong saprophytes and able to survive in the absence of host plants by feeding on organic matter (Sneh et al., 1996). In general, the infection process of R. solani includes adhesion, penetration, colonization, and host reaction. Isolates of the fungus infect a host plant mostly by formation of infection cushions on rice (Matsuura, 1986). ;   ;   ;  ",Rhizoctonia do not form spores,,,Rhizoctonia solani_NA_NA

It was discovered more than 100 years ago. R. solani frequently exists as thread-like growth on plants or in culture, and is considered a soil-borne pathogen. R. solani is best known to cause various plant diseases such as collar rot, root rot, damping off, and wire stem. R. solani attacks its hosts when they are in their early stages of development, such as seeds and seedlings, which are typically found in the soil. The pathogen is known to cause serious plant losses by attacking primarily the roots and lower stems of plants. Although it has a wide range of hosts, its main targets are herbaceous plants. R. solani would be considered a basidiomycete fungus if the teleomorph stage were more abundant. The pathogen is not currently known to produce any asexual spores (conidia), though it is considered to have an asexual lifecycle. Occasionally, sexual spores (basidiospores) are produced on infected plants. The disease cycle of R. solani is important in management and control of the pathogen. ; The genome sequence and gene models of Rhizoctonia solani AG-3 Rhs1AP were not determined by the Joint Genome Institute (JGI), but were downloaded from Ensembl Fungi on April 11, 2020.

As a symbiont, R. irregularis is highly effective in mobilizing, taking up and transferring mineral nutrients, such as inorganic orthophosphate ions (Pi), N and sulfur (S), from soils to plants and it readily colonizes many plants, including agriculturally important crop species as well as model plants such as Medicago truncatula, Lotus japonicus and Populus trichocarpa. R. irregularis is one of the most studied AM fungi as it rapidly colonizes its host plants, and it is a model species for dissecting the molecular and cellular biology of the Glomeromycota. It is readily amenable to in vitro culture on transformed host roots and is the only species for which spores are available commercially in pure form in large quantities. ;   ; The comparative analyses of gene repertoires in R. irregularis, pathogenic obligate biotrophs and ectomycorrhizal fungi offer insights into genes that may be involved in obligate biotrophy and mycorrhizal symbioses ;   ; The present R. irregularis genome, the first for Glomeromycota, provides a basis for future research in environmental genomics and for accessing symbiosis-related functional features in other members of this unique phylum.",,,,Rhizophagus irregularis_160_95

These arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) perform vital functions in the phosphorus cycle that are fundamental to sustainable crop plant productivity. The unusual biological features of AMF have long fascinated evolutionary biologists. The coenocytic hyphae host a community of hundreds of nuclei and reproduce clonally through large multinucleated spores. It has been suggested that the AMF maintain a stable assemblage of several different genomes during the life cycle, but this genomic organization has been questioned. ;   ; Rhizophagus irregularis DAOM197198 ; In 2013, we have published the haploid genome of Rhizophagus irregularis DAOM197198 and its repertoire of 28,232 genes. The observed low level of genome polymorphism is not consistent with the occurrence of multiple, highly diverged genomes. The expansion of mating-related genes suggests the existence of cryptic sex-related processes. A comparison of gene categories confirms that R. irregularis is close to the Mucoromycotina. The AMF obligate biotrophy is not explained by genome erosion or any related loss of metabolic complexity in central metabolism, but is marked by a lack of genes encoding plant cell wall degrading enzymes and of genes involved in toxin and thiamine synthesis. A battery of mycorrhiza-induced secreted proteins is expressed in symbiotic tissues. ; The initial genome sequence assembly from R. irregularis DAOM197198 was highly fragmented with 28,371scaffolds. The genome sequence was therefore re-sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq2500 using 3kb- and 8kb-mate pair Nextera libraries and one paire-end (2 x 125 bp) TruSeq Nano library on early 2015. The genome sequence was assembled with ALLPATHS-LG and the novel assembly contains 1123 scaffolds only. The JGI Annotation Pipeline predicted 25,930 genes. ; The Mycorrhizal Genomics Initiative is a large collaborative effort aiming for master publication(s) describing the evolution of the mycorrhizal symbioses.

While genus Rhizopogon associates with many EM host trees in family Pinaceae, R. vesiculosus is an obligate EM symbiont of Pseudotsuga menziesii (Douglas fir) (Massicotte et al. 1994). Along with its sister species, Rhizopogon vinicolor, R. vesiculosus makes up a major component of the  EM fungal community colonizing the roots of P. menziesii across all forest age classes (Twieg et al. 2007) and is especially abundant in young stands following disturbance (Luoma et al. 2006).  P. menziesii is a tree of major ecological and economic importance. It is a dominant overstory tree in coniferous forests of the North American Pacific Northwest and it has been planted on a global scale as a source of high quality timber. Rhizopogon vesiculosus occurs throughout the natural  range of P. menziesii in coastal western North America and is an important factor in the establishment and maintenance of P. menziesii forests.   R. vesiculosus and R. vinicolor produce sporocarps that are difficult to distinguish morphologically yet they differ greatly in life history. They can occur in relatively equal abundance when found at the same site but R. vinicolor typically produces smaller genets and possesses little population structure on the landscape scale while R. vesiculosus produces larger genets and shows patterns of inbreeding at the landscape scale (Kretzer et al. 2005, Beiler et al. 2010, Dunham et al. 2013). Rhizopogon vinicolor also undergoes vertical partitioning into a realized niche in the upper soil horizon when co-occuring with R. vesiculosus as the result of competitive interactions (Beiler et al. 2012, Mujic et al. 2016). The differential population structure of R. vesiculosus and R. vinicolor might be explained by the greater likelihood of R. vesiculosus mating with a close relative due to its larger genet size (Dunham et al. 2013) or by selective pressure for outcrossing in R. vinicolor (Mujic et al. 2016). Genome assemblies will provide additional insight into the differential population structure of these fungi by providing an opportunity for the investigation of their mating systems.  At the broader scale, the genomes of Rhizopogon vesiculosus and Rhizopogon vinicolor will allow deeper inquiry into the ecology and evolutionary biology of sympatric EM sister species. They will enable phylogenomic and population genomic studies of genus Rhizopogon and will allow for the study of genetic mechanisms that underly EM host specificity. ; References ; Beiler, K. J., D.

Endophytes are microorganisms that live within plants without causing disease while generally providing growth benefits to the plant. Strain WP1 produces indole-3-acetic acid, a plant growth hormone and enhances growth of several different plant species. As an endophyte, WP1 is well-adapted to the plant environment, giving it several useful characteristics for biofuel and biochemical production. WP1 utilizes hexose as well as pentose sugars, produces high levels of the sugar alcohol, xylitol, and is resistant to several phytochemicals known to inhibit industrial yeast strains.

This type of fruiting body is very widespread in mushroom forming fungi, particularly in the large order Agaricales, but Rickenella is a member of the Hymenochaetales, an order containing mostly resupinate (crustlike) forms as well as many bracket fungi with hard, corky fruiting bodies and rusty brown colors (such as Fomitiporia mediterranea, which has been previously sequenced by the JGI). Thus, Rickenella represents an independent origin of the agaricoid habit. Rickenella is one of the earlier-branching members of the Hymenochaetales and molecular phylogenies suggest a high pace of phenotypic evolution in the early evolution of this order, which has produced a considerable diversity of nutritional modes and morphologies. Ecological strategies include saprotrophs (decayers), moss-associated and ectomycorrhizal fungi, whereas fruiting body morphologies range from mushrooms, coral-fungi, resupinate to the dominant polypore (bracket fungus) morphology. Within this consortium, the genome sequence of Rickenella will provide us with an insight into the early episode of the evolution of a speciose clade where the rate of phenotype evolution has been most likely elevated. The genome sequence of Rickenella will be used in a comparative analysis of fruiting body types in the Agaricomycetes, where it will represent one of the independent origins of the mushroom morphology. The genome of Rickenella mellea will also contribute to a better understanding of the nutritional modes in the Agaricomycetes. There are several groups of Agaricomycetes associated with mosses, many of which are difficult or impossible to grow in culture. However, the precise nature of the interaction of the fungus with the moss is not known. Rickenella is unusual among moss-associated Agaricomycetes in being relatively easy to bring into culture. We expect to better understand the nutritional strategy of this species by analyzing its genome.",,,,Rickenella mellea_NA_NA

Please note that this copy of the genome is not maintained by the author and is therefore not automatically updated. ; Rozella allomycis is the first member of the recently described phylum Cryptomycota (Jones et al. 2011a) to have its genome sequenced. The genus Rozella is mostly known to parasitize water molds, and R. allomycis is an obligate parasite of the Blastocladiomycotan fungus Allomyces. The phylum is otherwise known exclusively from a large number of environmental DNA sequences produced in aquatic, marine, and other habitats (Jones et al. 2011b; Lara et al. 2011). R. allomycis grows within the host as naked protoplasm, and reproduces through the production of ephemeral zoosporangia or chitinous, thick-walled resting sporangia. The parasite requires the host to produce the cell wall of the zoosporangium, which at maturity cleave into numerous zoospores with a single flagellum. The zoospore, upon finding a suitable host, retracts its flagellum, develops a cell wall, and injects its cytoplasm into the host. The parasite protoplasm is suspected of being capable of phagocytosing the host's cytoplasm (Powell 1984). The ancestral characteristic of phagotrophy as well as phylogenetic analyses have placed the Cryptomycota at the base of the fungal tree (James et al. 2006). Recently, the analysis of the genome sequence of Rozella suggested that Cryptomycota and the obligate eukaryotic parasites known as Microsporidia are related (James et al. 2013). Microsporidia are well known for their fast rate of evolution, including loss of the mitochondrion and reduction of nuclear genome size. Shared characteristics of Cryptomycota and Microsporidia include presence of a chitinous cell wall, growth inside the host as a naked protoplasm, presence of ATP transport proteins acquired from Chlamydia, and remarkably little else. ;   ;   ;   ;   ;   ; ",,,,Rozella allomycis_NA_NA

In order to allow comparative analyses with other fungal genomes sequenced by the JGI, a copy of this genome is incorporated into Mycocosm. JGI tools were used to automatically annotate predicted proteins. Please note that this copy of the genome is not maintained by NCBI and is therefore not automatically updated. ; Saccharomyces arboricolus was isolated from different regions in China from Fagaceae trees by the team of Feng-Yan Bai. Genetic crosses with other Saccharomyces species and spore viability analysis support a distinct biological species. Genome sequence unambiguously shows a separate phylogenetic species.

Wickerham from a rotting banana in Costa Rica (Mortimer and Johnston, Genetics. 1986 May;113(1):35-43) and is publically available from the USDA Agricultural Research Service Culture Collection and the CBS-KNAW Fungal Biodiversity Center.  Comparative genome sequence analysis of YB-210, along with other stress-tolerant strains, to sequenced sensitive strains will allow for a better understanding of the genetic determinants for stress tolerance during lignocellulosic fermentation processes.",,,,Saccharomyces cerevisiae_NA_NA

This metabolic ability is desirable for biofuel production, since xylose is a common sugar in lignocellulose, and very few yeast species are capable of fermenting xylose. Although it was long-referred to as Pichia stipitis, the species was reclassified as an original founding member of the genus Scheffersomyces (2). This strain has been compared with another previously sequenced strain for its ability to ferment xylose, with minimal performance differences found between the strains (3). More information about Scheffersomyces (formerly Pichia) stipitis can be found here.References 1. Toivola A, Yarrow D, van den Bosch E, van Dijken JP, Scheffers WA. (1984).

Strains of P. stipitis are among the best xylose-fermenting yeasts in type culture collections. 4 Fed batch cultures of P. stipitis produce up to 47 g/L of ethanol from xylose at 30°C under low aeration conditions. 5P. stipitis belongs to a group of yeasts that uses an alternative nuclear genetic code in which CUG codes for serine rather than leucine. ; Pichia stipitis is of fundamental biological interest and important to the national interest because of its unique ability to ferment xylose rapidly. Increasing the capacity of P. stipitis for rapid xylose fermentation could enhance the productivity and sustainability of agriculture and forestry by providing new outlets for agricultural and wood harvest residues. Agricultural productivity would be greatly improved and incomes for farmers would increase if there were larger markets for agricultural residues. ; P. stipitis CBS 6054 is unusual in that it is the best of only a few yeasts known to ferment xylose to ethanol in high yield. It is related to several yeasts that are found as endosymbionts of beetles that inhabit and degrade white-rotted wood. Unlike Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which regulates fermentation by sensing the presence of fermentable sugars such as glucose, Pichia stipitis induces fermentative activity in response to oxygen limitation. ;   ; References:",,,,Scheffersomyces stipitis_NA_NA

In screening these for divergent sequences, Peter Baumann and colleagues at the Stowers Institute identified one isolate clearly different at the sequence level from the three known species. The isolate first arose as a contaminant in handling S. octosporus stocks. S. cryophilus is indeed most closely related to S. octosporus, but the two are still as distantly related as humans and mouse.

While historically recognized as orchid mycorrhizae, recent DNA studies have brought to light both their pandemic distribution and the broad spectrum of mycorrhizal types they form (Oberwinkler et al., 2013). Indeed, ecological studies using molecular-based methods of detection have found Sebacinales fungi in field specimens of bryophytes (moss), pteridophytes (fern) and all families of herbaceous angiosperms (flowering plants) from temperate, subtropical and tropical regions. These natural host plants include, among others, liverworts, wheat, maize and Arabidopsis thaliana, the genetic model plant traditionally viewed as non-mycorrhizal (DeMars and Boerner 1996). ; The orchid mycorrhizal fungus Sebacina vermifera (MAFF 305830) was first isolated from the Australian orchid Cyrtostylis reniformis (Warcup J 1988). Research performed with this strain clearly indicates its plant growth promoting abilities in a variety of plants (e.g. Ghimire et al., 2009; Waller et al., 2008), demonstrating little or no host specificity. Considering their proven beneficial impact on plant growth and their apparent ubiquity, Sebacinales fungi should be considered as a previously hidden, but amenable and effective microbial tool for enhancing plant productivity and stress tolerance. However, research performed thus far towards understanding the biology and potentially agronomic utility of Sebacinales fungi all involved strains isolated from orchids. ; Hence full genome sequencing of this new strain of Sebacina vermifera (currently defined taxonomically as ssp. bescii) isolated from switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.), the first such strain from any North American plant, will provide insight into the phylogeography, genetic and physiological diversity, and the variety of mechanisms employed by these fungi for mycorrhizal symbiosis and crop improvement not only in switchgrass but also other agronomically important crops. ; References ; Ray P, Chi MH, Guo Y, Chen C, Adam C, Kuo A, LaButti K, Lipzen A, Barry KW, Grigoriev IV, Tang Y and Craven KD (2018) Genome sequence of the plant growth promoting fungus Serendipita vermifera subsp. bescii: The first native strain from North America.

The ecology of Sistotremastrum and other members of the Trechisporales is poorly understood. Sistotremastrum species produce their resupinate fruiting bodies on decaying wood, but it is not known what their mechanisms of decay may be, or if they also form symbioses with other organisms.

Efficient fermentation of xylose, a five-carbon sugar that is a major component of plant cell walls, is a major step towards effective biofuel production from plant materials. Therefore, an increased understanding of the molecular mechanisms controlling xylose fermentation in fungi will be gained from comparative study of the genomes of P. stipitis, C. tenuis, and S. passalidarum. This work, in collaboration with the DOE Great Lakes Bioenergy Research Center (GLBRC), will help further the DOE's mission of removing bottlenecks in the biofuels pipeline, and increasing the availability of products produced from renewable plant biomass. C. tenuis and S. passalidarum were chosen for this study because they have xylose fermentation capacities that are comparable to P. stipitis under certain conditions. Furthermore, preliminary sequencing results suggest that the similarity of these three species is such that phylogenetic footprinting and ortholog comparisons will be possible. Although the discovery of S. passalidarum as a xylose fermenting fungi is relatively recent, it was chosen for sequencing based on our assessment that this species will be the most powerful in understanding the P. stipitis genome through comparative genomics. On the other hand, C. tenuis has been recognized for its xylose fermenting capacity for many years, and its xylose reductase enzymes have been studied. Consequently, a community of C. tenuis researchers exists who would greatly benefit from the genome sequence of this organism. Finally, C. tenuis and S. passalidarum are also unusual in that they are found in symbiotic association with wood-boring beetles, and comparative study may give new insight into the genetic underpinnings of symbiotic relationships.",,,,Spathaspora passalidarum_NA_NA

Sphaerobolus is a member of the Phallomycetidae, which is a morphologically diverse group that also includes coral fungi, stinkhorns, earthstars, and false truffles (Geml et al., 2005; Hibbett et al., 1997; Hosaka et al., 2006). Sphaerobolus produces tiny fruit bodies that violently eject a slimy packet of spores, called a gleba. The biomechanics of this cannon are astonishing: the gleba is discharged at a speed of 10 meters per second (36 km/h) and can travel 6 meters! Sphaerobolus is most commonly encountered on wood chips and bark mulch used in landscaping, sometimes producing huge numbers of fruiting bodies. In such circumstances, Sphaerobolus can become a nuisance, because the darkly pigmented and highly-adhesive glebal masses accumulate on adjacent surfaces, including cars, painted walls, and foliage of ornamental plants. Sphaerobolus is of interest to the DOE because it is able to decompose plant cell wall material, and could be a source of enzymes used in industrial bioconversion processes. The Phallomycetidae is an early-diverging lineage of Agaricomycetes (mushroom-forming fungi), which is not closely related to the best-known model organisms for decay biology (such as Postia placenta and Phanerochaete chrysosporium in the Polyporales, or Pleurotus ostreatus in the Agaricales).

Sphaerobolus is a member of the Phallomycetidae, which is a morphologically diverse group that also includes coral fungi, stinkhorns, earthstars, and false truffles (Geml et al., 2005; Hibbett et al., 1997; Hosaka et al., 2006). Sphaerobolus produces tiny fruit bodies that violently eject a slimy packet of spores, called a gleba. The biomechanics of this cannon are astonishing: the gleba is discharged at a speed of 10 meters per second (36 km/h) and can travel 6 meters! Sphaerobolus is most commonly encountered on wood chips and bark mulch used in landscaping, sometimes producing huge numbers of fruiting bodies. In such circumstances, Sphaerobolus can become a nuisance, because the darkly pigmented and highly-adhesive glebal masses accumulate on adjacent surfaces, including cars, painted walls, and foliage of ornamental plants. Sphaerobolus is of interest to the DOE because it is able to decompose plant cell wall material, and could be a source of enzymes used in industrial bioconversion processes. The Phallomycetidae is an early-diverging lineage of Agaricomycetes (mushroom-forming fungi), which is not closely related to the best-known model organisms for decay biology (such as Postia placenta and Phanerochaete chrysosporium in the Polyporales, or Pleurotus ostreatus in the Agaricales). Sphaerobolus is the first member of the Phallomycetidae to be subject to whole genome sequencing, and it is therefore likely to possess novel suites of enzymes for degradation of lignocellulose.",,,,Sphaerobolus stellatus_8_6

Like all chytrids, Spizellomyces produces uniflagellated zoospores during its reproductive cycle, but in contrast to other zoosporic fungi (e.g. Allomyces), spizellomycetalean zoospores can be amoeboid while actively swimming, and the flagellar insertion site may move to a lateral position. ; Spizellomyces species are exclusively terrestrial. They are common in soil and of importance in terrestrial ecosystems - with both beneficial and detrimental impacts - found in association with a range of mycorrhizal fungi, mildew, plants and soil nematodes. In biochemical research, S. punctatus has gained attention because of the presence of mitochondrial 5' tRNA editing, a form of post-transcriptional RNA processing previously only known from the unrelated amoeboid protist Acanthamoeba castellanii. The RNA editing activities of both Acanthamoeba and Spizellomyces have been partially purified, biochemically characterized, and compared. ;   ; Credit ;   ;   ;  ","Genetic transformation of Spizellomyces punctatus, a resource for studying chytrid biology and evolutionary cell biology",,,Spizellomyces punctatus_4_4

Ustilago maydis and the related fungus Sporisorium reilianum both parasitize maize. Their life cycle leading to the infectious form is similar; however, shortly after infection U. maydis locally induces tumors on all aerial parts of the plant, whereas S. reilianum spreads systemically and causes symptoms in male and female inflorescences only. Both S. reilianum and U. maydis establish an intimate communication with their host through secreted protein effectors that enable biotrophic development. Effector proteins like U. maydis Pep1 can suppress plant defense responses. Additional effector genes were identified in the genome as genes encoding U. maydis specific secreted proteins, most of which are up-regulated during host colonization. Many of these effector genes are clustered, and deletion of five of these clusters affected virulence in seedlings. Some cluster genes are induced in specific plant organs, and respective cluster mutants show altered virulence depending on the host tissue infected. In plant parasitic oomycetes, genes for effector proteins are under diversifying selection and occur in highly flexible genomic regions. ;   ;  ",I did not find spore data.

Researchers who wish to publish analyses using data from unpublished SAP genomes are respectfully required to contact the PI and JGI to avoid potential conflicts on data use and coordinate other publications with the SAP master paper(s). ; Stereum hirsutum (Willd.) Pers. is a Basidiomycete that produces persistent, resupinate, effused-reflexed or even pileate basidiocarps with a smooth or tuberculate hymenophore. Basidiocarps of the species are usually collected on dead parts of living hardwood trees or occasionally conifers or even on branches fallen on the ground. The species has a worldwide distribution and belongs to the pioneer wood-rotting species to colonize wood. Initially placed in the artificial group of corticioid fungi, recent phylogenetic studies place Stereum hirsutum in the Russuloid clade. The placement of the species in the Russuloid clade makes it an appropriate candidate for comparative studies with Heterobasidion annosum (Fr.) Bref., a strong conifer pathogen placed also in the Russuloid clade, which was recently sequenced by the Joint Genome Institute. Furthermore the species produces a white type rot but no details are known about the gene content related to the white rot biochemistry for the species. There are studies supporting the presence of manganese peroxidases and laccases, while it has been shown that the species can bleach kraft lignin. The genome of Stereum hirsutum will increase our knowledge about the white rot mechanism of the wood rotting species of the clade.

The fungus colonizes developing ovules of Rhynchospora spp. (Cyperaceae) to produce hypertrophied galls. The isolate selected for genome sequencing (MCA3645) was grown on a potato dextrose agar (PDA) plate from an infected Rhynchospora species in Louisiana, and may represent the only known cultured strain of T. cyperi. In culture, the fungus initially forms white to cream yeast-like colonies, and becoming friable and yellow to tan in age with a filliform margin. ; Testicularia species were traditionally classified in Cintractiaceae with Cintractia, Trichocintractia and related genera based on similar host plants, similarities in sorus development and basidial structure (Vánky, 2001). However, molecular phylogenetic analyses of several rDNA loci showed that Cintractiaceae was non-monophyletic (Begerow et al., 2006). Thus most members of Cintractiaceae were moved to other families (Begerow et al., 2006). However, due to a lack of molecular data, the genus Testicularia was not included in that study, and it is still designated as incertae sedis in modern classifications (Begerow et al., 2014). ; The genome sequence of T. cyperi will provide the first whole genome reference sequence for a smut fungus in the Ustilaginales that is not in the Ustilaginaceae. Researchers will use these data in phylogenetic and phylogenomic reconstructions and in comparative genomics studies that seek to elucidate the molecular bases governing production of sexual and anamorphic states and the evolution of phytopathogenicity in Ustilaginomycotina. ;  ;  ;   ;   ;    ; References: ;   ; Begerow D, Stoll M, Bauer R. 2006.

Later, the original strain was no longer available, so Tilletiopsis washingtonensis Nyland was designated as a neotype (Nyland, 1950) for the genus. The fungus forms cream to tan yeast-like colonies on agar media. These colonies consist of mycelium producing ballistospores by budding. Hyaline chlamydospores may be formed in older cultures (Nyland, 1950). The strain selected for genome sequencing was isolated from the phylloplane of a Geranium leaf. ; Phylogenetic analyses of rDNA loci among ustilaginomycetous anamophic fungi show that T. washingtonensis belongs to Entylomatales (Begerow and Bauer, 2000; Begerow et al., 2002). This fungus was initially recognized as a non-phytopathogenic yeast based on several studies in which it was found on the surface of healthy plants (Nyland, 1950; Urquhart and Punja, 2002). Tilletiopsis washingtonensis has also been isolated from air (Marchisio et al., 1992). In addition to being an epiphytic yeast, there were several trials of using T. washingtonensis as a biocontrol agent against powdery mildew disease on cucumbers (Urquhart et al., 1994; Urquhart and Punja, 2002). However, current studies reported that T. washingtonensis and other certain Tilletiopsis species were a major cause of white haze postharvest disorder of apples in Europe (Boekhout et al., 2006; Baric et al., 2010). ; The genome sequence of T. washingtonensis will provide the first whole genome reference sequence for a member of Entylomatales. Researchers will use these data in phylogenetic and phylogenomic reconstructions and in comparative genomics studies that seek to elucidate the molecular bases governing production of sexual and anamorphic states and the evolution of phytopathogenicity in Ustilaginomycotina. ;   ; Tilletiopsis washingtonensis culture on potato dextrose agar.

Trichoderma Online, Systematic Mycology and Microbiology Laboratory, ARS, USDA. ; The filamentous fungus Trichoderma asperellum is the genetically distinct agamospecies with cosmopolitan distribution. Together with T. atroviride (teleomorph Hypocrea atroviridis) it belongs to the phylogenetically ancestral section Trichoderma of the mycoparasitic genus Trichoderma (teleomorph Hypocrea, Ascomycota, Dikarya). T. asperellum is frequently isolated from root-free soil, soil litter, rhizosphere of various plants, healthy plant tissues, fungal biomass and dead wood. The broad spectrum of its substrata suggests its outstanding environmental opportunism ranging from saprotrophy to biotrophy.  Similar to T. atroviride, T. asperellum is a powerful antagonist of other fungi as it is able to parasitize on them (necrootrophic hyperparasitism or mycoparasitism) or inhibit their growth and development. Therefore this species is utilized as biological control agents against a wide spectrum of plant-pathogenic fungi, fungi-like protozoa such as Phytophthora megakarya and also nematodes. T. asperellum also has been shown to have antibacterial activity through the production of trichotoxin peptaibols. Similar to T. harzianum, T. asperellum is suggested to be a powerful environmental opportunist, which is able to interplay in communities of invasive Trichoderma spp. in various disturbed ecosystems and thus replace or suppress the local mycofauna. Hyphae of T. asperellum may not only grow on plant roots, but also penetrate root epidermis (endophytism), which enhances plant growth and immune system. T. asperellum has been particularly investigated for its ability to stimulate the plants defense reactions against plant pathogens. The genome of T. asperellum will help to understand the evolution of the genus Trichoderma in general and the evolution of Trichoderma mycoparasitism and environmental opportunism and thus help to reveal mechanisms to be used for further domestication of these fungi.","Trichoderma asperellum, a new species with warted conidia, and redescription of T. viride",,,Trichoderma asperellum_3.8_3.2

Strains of T. brevicompactum can inhibit the growth of some plant pathogenic fungi and can modulate the response of plants to drought stress. As a result, some T. brevicompactum strains are considered to have potential in biocontrol of fungal diseases of crop plants. DNA-sequence-based phylogenetic analyses have placed T. brevicompactum in the Brevicompactum clade of Trichoderma. Some members of this clade are unusual among Trichoderma species in that they produce trichothecenes, a family of terpenoid toxins. Although over 150 trichothecene analogs have been described from species of at least 10 fungal genera, members of the Brevicompactum clade have been reported to produce only two analogs, trichodermin and harzianum A, as well as their biosynthetic intermediates. It is likely that these trichothecenes contribute to antifungal activity of at least some members of the Brevicompactum clade, including T. brevicompactum. Three loci with trichothecene biosynthetic (tri) genes have been identified in T. brevicompactum strain IBT 40841, and the roles of some of the genes in trichothecene biosynthesis have been confirmed by functional analysis.

Trichoderma Online Systematic Mycology and Microbiology Laboratory, ARS, USDA. ; The filamentous fungus Trichoderma harzianum sensu stricto is the genetically distinct temperate agamospecies belonging to the group of closely related (cryptic), albeit diverse, species of the Harzianum clade of Trichoderma (teleomorph Hypocrea, Ascomycota, Dikarya). In the broad taxonomic sense these fungi (T. harzianum sensu lato) are the most frequent Trichoderma species cultivated from soil worldwide. They display a remarkable diversity of lifestyles ranging from saprotrophy in free soil and dead wood, in rhizosphere and on dead fungal biomass to biotrophy in necrotrophic mycoparasisitic attacks of other fungi and endophytic associations with plants. Because of its mycotrophyc ability T. harzianum has often been set equal to Trichoderma-based biocontrol agents in general, as it is the principal component in several commercial biofungicide formulations. It is used for foliar application, seed and soil treatments for suppression of various diseases causing by such pathogens as Botrytis, Fusarium and Penicillium sp. Although T. harzianum is not a causative agent of the green mold disease on mushroom farms it is frequently isolated from infected cultures of Agaricus and Pleurotus and respective substrata. Interestingly, the causative agents of the mushroom green mold diseases (T. aggressivum, T. pleurotum and T. pleuroticola, respectively) also belong to the Harzianum clade, i.e. are closely related to T. harzianum. Similar to T. virens (teleomorph Hypocrea virens), a rhizosphere-competent T. harzianum may not only grow on plant roots, but its hyphae penetrate root epidermis (endophytism), which enhances plant growth and immune system. Some molecular mechanisms of Trichoderma mycotrophy and interactions with plants - such as the role and regulation of formation of cell wall hydrolytic enzymes and antagonistic secondary metabolites - have been intensively investigated in T. harzianum. As a mycoparasitic and antagonistic fungus T. harzianum is suggested to be a powerful environmental opportunist, which is able to interplay in communities of invasive Trichoderma spp. in various disturbed ecosystems and thus replace or suppress the local mycofauna. Hence the genome sequence of such an outstanding opportunistic fungus as T. harzianum is expected to provide a platform to identify genetic resource to be used in pest control, development of biofungicides, improvement of plant health and in environmental monitoring.",,,,Trichoderma harzianum_39.7125_39.4125

It has often even been synonymized with Trichoderma biocontrol agents in general, as it is the principal component in several commercial bio-fungicide formulations. This biocontrol ability is commonly associated with other Trichoderma activities, for example, the ability to produce a great variety of antifungal metabolites like secondary metabolites and hydrolytic enzymes. In addition to their mycoparasitic activity, Trichoderma species are rhizosphere-competent, being able to colonize and grow in association with plant shoots and roots as previously described for cucumber, cotton, maize, tomato, pepper, lettuce, bean, and other plants. This association changes the plant development (growth and metabolism) and also induces defense responses and resistance to subsequent fungal attack. This Trichoderma strain was isolated from Brazilian Cerrado soil and exhibited efficient biological control against the fungi Rhizoctonia solani, Fusarium solani, Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, and other pathogens that impact dry bean crop production in Brazil.

When grown on Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA) substrate, the typical mycelial culture is light olive-green in color, often with a diffuse yellow pigmentation. The conidia are green, smooth-walled and ellipsoid- to obovoid in shape. This fungus has been noted as a causal agent of invasive fungal infections in immunocompromised patients and in various mycoses.

Please note that this copy of the genome is not maintained by the author and is therefore not automatically updated. ; The two dermatophyte species Arthroderma benhamiae and Trichophyton verrucosum are both zoophilic, yet the natural reservoir of T. verrucosum is almost exclusively cattle, whereas A. benhamiae is usually found on rodents, in particular guinea pigs. The two species also differ in their ability to grow under laboratory conditions, with T. verrucosum being very difficult to cultivate at all. Conversely, A. benhamiae is comparatively fast growing and produces abundant microconidia. As a teleomorphic species, the fungus is even able to undergo sexual development, including the formation of sexual fructifications (cleistothecia). These characteristics, together with the recent establishment of a guinea pig infection model and a genetic system for targeted gene deletion for this species, suggest A. benhamiae is a useful model organism to investigate the fundamental biology and pathogenicity of dermatophytes. Despite the above mentioned phenotypic differences, A. benhamiae and T. verrucosum are phylogenetically very closely related, and both induce highly inflammatory cutaneous infections in humans, such as tinea corporis. Therefore, a genome comparison of the two species should reveal common basic pathogenicity-associated traits. ;  ",I did not find spore data,,,Trichophyton verrucosum_NA_NA

To better understand the genome evolution of fungi that participate in the orchid mycorrhizal symbiosis, we are sequencing a variety of fungal species that have been demonstrated to germinate orchid seeds. Analyses of these genomes will reveal patterns that may explain their ability to interact with orchids.Tulasnella calospora UAMH 9824 was isolated from a primary lateral root of Spiranthes brevilabris in Levy County, Florida, USA. This species has been nicknamed, the “Super fungus” because of its ability to germinate seeds from a variety of orchid species from a variety of geographic locations.

Analyses of these genomes will provide insight into the diversity of mechanisms for the mycorrhizal symbiosis, including endo- and ectomycorrhiza. ; For their development, all orchids rely on the association with symbiotic fungi like Tulasnella calospora, that (at least in the early stages) provide the plant with organic carbon. T. calospora is the most common mycorrhizal partner of green orchids and belongs to the phylum Basidiomycota (order Cantharellales, family Tulasnellaceae). This fungus is distributed world-wide and normally found in every ecosystem, from tropical to temperate climate zones. Unlike some other symbiotic fungi identified in orchids, T. calospora can be easily cultivated in vitro. Thanks to these features T. calospora seems to be the best candidate model species for genome sequencing. In particular, T. calospora AL13/4D was isolated from mycorrhizal roots of the Mediterranean green orchid Anacamptis laxiflora. In our experiments, this strain proved to be the most effective in promoting symbiotic seed germination and plantlet development in vitro. Orchid symbiosis is still poorly studied, and T. calospora genome sequencing will allow us to make considerable advances in our understanding of the genetic and functional bases of the association, including carbon and nitrogen transfer to the host plant.",Perfect states of Rhizoctonias associated with orchids,,,Tulasnella calospora_31_3.25

Zygomycetes are an ancient and diverse group of fungi, whose evolutionary history and ecological associations remain poorly resolved. The ZygoLife project aims to: 1) reconstruct the genealogical relationships of this early diverging branch in the fungal tree of life; 2) resolve the origins of symbiotic relationships between plants and zygomycetes; 3) reveal how complex body plans evolved in the group; 4) elucidate mechanisms of mating genetics between organisms with complex and differing life cycles, and; 5) develop genomic barcodes to facilitate identification of unknown fungi. Towards these goals we are sequencing genomes of diverse representative zygomycete taxa.  Formerly classified as belonging to Mortierella, phylogenetic analysis has shown that Umbelopsis isabellina belongs to the subphylum Mucoromycotina (phylum Mucoromycota). Umbelopsis isabellina comprises a complex of species that are widely distributed in the Northern and Southern hemispheres. These fungi are important industrially given their unique lipid and fatty acid metabolism, and high level of intracellular lipid accumulation from various feedstocks. Umbelopsis isabellina is commonly isolated from soil and plant roots, however, its biology and ecology is not well understood.  Umbelopsis isabellina AD026 was isolated from soil collected near the Humphrey’s Peak in North Arizona.",Compendium of Soil Fungi,,,Umbelopsis isabellina_2.5_2.5

The sequence divergence of the 18S ribosomal gene between C. immitis and U. reesii is approximately 0.7%, reflecting approximately 20-30 million years evolutionary distance (Bowman, White et al. 1996). Coccidioides species cause serious and sometimes fatal disease (coccidiomycosis) in otherwise healthy people. The U.S. government regulates both C. posadasii and C. immitis under the Select Agent Program as potential bioterrorist threats. For this reason, Coccidioides is an active target of molecular genetic and clinical investigation. The genome sequences of both C. posadasii and C. immitis are now available. However, unlike these Coccidioides species, U. reesii is nonpathogenic.

JGI tools were used to automatically annotate predicted proteins. Note that this is an updated annotation of the U. maydis version deposited in NCBI, which is also available in MycoCosm. ; From the NCBI genome page: ; Ustilago maydis, also known as Ustilago zeae, is a basidiomycete fungus that usually exists as a filamentous mycelium in nature. Unlike typical basidiomycetes, it does not have a real fruiting body. During its life cycle it produces a large sac containing resting, diploid teliospores. These spores germinate and form haploid basidiospores by meiosis. Haploid hyphae of opposite mating type can fuse and form a filamentous, dikaryotic cell type. The haploid Ustilago maydis genome is approximately 20.5 Mb, organized in 23 chromosomes. Ustilago maydis is the causal agent of corn smut disease. This fungal pathogen infects growing maize and teosinte plants, leading to the formation of large tumor-like masses filled with spores, stunted plant growth, and reduced crop yield. Corn smut disease causes severe damage and losses of corn, one of the world's major cereal crops, every year. However, in Mexico and Central America, corn smut is considered a culinary delicacy (huitlacoche). Ustilago maydis is an excellent model system for studying host-pathogen interactions, and it has been studied for more than 100 years by plant pathologists. This organism can be cultured easily under laboratory conditions on young corn plants and on synthetic media, where it grows as a single-celled yeast. It is amenable to molecular manipulations, such as transformation and homologous gene replacement. Molecular genetic research with Ustilago maydis focuses on signaling pathways that influence virulence, the role of mating in pathogenesis, and recombination (the Holliday junction, a DNA recombinant structure, was first observed in this species). Recently, the fungus has emerged as an excellent experimental model for the molecular genetic analysis of phytopathogenesis, particularly in the characterization of infection-specific morphogenesis in response to signals from host plants. Ustilago maydis also serves as an important model for other basidiomycete plant pathogens that are more difficult to work with in the laboratory, such as the rust and bunt fungi. The genomic sequence of Ustilago maydis will be valuable in comparative analyses with other fungal genomes, especially for understanding the host range of fungal phytopathogens. It will also aid in identifying molecular targets for the development of antifungal drugs.

The wide host range of V. dahliae, together with its ability to rapidly adapt to diverse ecological niches and to colonize plant hosts as pathogen and endophyte makes it an interesting model to study the mechanisms involved in the maintenance of endophytism and pathogenesis. Consistent with that, several V. dahliae isolates have been isolated from the roots of healthy plants, suggesting they can also live benignly as endophyte within plant tissues. The sequenced Verticillium dahliae MPI-CAGE-AT-0001 has been isolated from surface sterilized roots of healthy Arabidopsis thaliana grown in the Cologne Agricultural Soil. The sequencing of this fungal isolate is part of a larger project aiming at sequencing the genomes of numerous phylogenetically diverse root-associated fungi from Arabidopsis, Populus, and other plant hosts for further comparative genome analysis. Unravelling the genomic signatures reflecting the adaptation of these microbes to the host cell environment represents a promising way to better understand how the endophytic lifestyle evolved in phylogenetically unrelated fungal species.

The genus name derives from the “verticilliate” morphological feature of the branched conidiophore, the hyphal structure that bears conidia. Verticillium longisporum substantially shares the disease cycle characteristics with the more studied V. dahliae. The species name “longisporum” refers to the close to twice as long conidia found in most strains in comparison to V. dahliae. V. longisporum causes stunting but not wilting in infected plants and the disease is now called Verticillium stem stripe. This soil-borne pathogen preferentially cause disease on plant species in Brassicaceae.  ; A major problem is the longevity of its microsclerotia that are released into the soil from infected plant residues at the end of the disease cycle. These resting structures have the capacity to remain dormant in soil for many years. It is thought that the microsclerotia are stimulated to germinate via root exudates released from a host plant growing nearby. The hyphae then invade the lateral roots and root hairs followed by colonization of the root tissues and finally enter into the xylem elements. Next, conidia form and these spores can spread via the plant’s transpiration stream. Thus conidia are able to colonize vessel tissue further up in the plant, processes which could interfere with access to the xylem sap potentially affecting plant growth. Because the microsclerotia do not form and protrude stems and leaves until the plant is in the senescence phase, the disease easily remains unnoticed.",,,,Verticillium longisporum_4.25_2.3

The mushroom was held in such high regard that it was often presented as a tribute to Chinese royalty ; In addition to rice straw, V. volvacea also grows on water-hyacinth, palm oil bunch wastes, pericarp wastes, banana leaves, and cotton waste. Considered a health food because of its dietary and medicinal attributes, the mushroom is popular in southern China, Thailand, Malaysia and the Philippines. Previously ranked fifth among the major commercially-cultivated mushrooms, annual production of V. volvacea has increased in recent years due to a higher demand for health foods. In 2010, output of the mushroom on the Chinese mainland was 330,000 tons, accounting for more than 80% of global production. ;  ",https://www.mushroomexpert.com/volvariella_volvacea.html,,,Volvariella volvacea_8_4.5

Please note that this copy of the genome is not maintained by the author and is therefore not automatically updated. ; Wallemia ichthyophaga is the most halophilic fungus known to date. It shows preference for media supplemented with salt over media with high concentrations of glucose and it grows only between 10% (w/v) NaCl and saturation. Such obligative halophily is common in Archaea, but unique in Fungi. ; The species is one of the three representatives of the genus Wallemia. It belongs to the class Wallemiomycetes, which, according to a phylogenomic analysis, is a 250-million-year-old sister group of Agaricomycotina. ; Wallemia ichthyophaga grows meristematically and forms characteristic compact multicellular clumps. When growing at higher salinity a three-fold thickening of the cell wall and an almost four-fold increase in the size of multicellular clumps occurs. The thick cell wall and compact cell clumps are thought to be important for the successful growth in extremely saline conditions. ; The genome of the W. ichthyophaga type strain isolated from hypersaline water of the Secovlje solar saltern (Adriatic coast, Slovenia) has been sequenced. The genome is among the smallest of known basidiomycetous genomes. It is only 9.6 Mb large, contains 1.67% repetitive sequences and 4,884 predicted protein coding genes (a number in the range observed for Escherichia coli), which cover almost three quarters of the sequence. The genome does not contain a recognizable mating type locus and the species appears to be asexual. A few protein families are significantly expanded (the P-type ATPase cation transporters and hydrophobins), wheras most of them are contracted. Surprisingly, most genes and mechanisms that are involved in salt tolerance in other fungi, do not appear substantially different in W. ichthyophaga. ; The vast enrichment of hydrophobins (cell-wall proteins with multiple cellular functions), which contain an unusually large number of acidic amino acids and are also transcriptionally responsive to salt, is one of the unusual discoveries resulting from the the genome and transcriptome analysis. Hydrophobins are of particular interest in industry, pharmaceutics and medicine due to their diverse applications. ; The genome of W. ichthyophaga (EXF-994) was sequenced by BGI-Shenzhen (Shenzhen, China). The sequenced strain, together with the few other known isolates of W. ichthyophaga, is preserved in the Ex culture collection of the Department of Biology, Biotechnical Faculty, University of Ljubljana, Slovenia (Infrastructural Centre Mycosmo, MRIC UL). ;  ",,,,Wallemia ichthyophaga_NA_NA

Wallemia sebi has been implicated as the causal agent in some human subcutaneous infections and respiratory disease. Several characteristics place Wallemia species, of which there are three, apart from other known fungi: they possess a unique form of conidiogenesis, are among the most xerotolerant fungi known, and hold an isolated phylogenetic position within the Basidiomycota as the sister class to all other Agaricomycotina (mushroom-forming fungi). Almost nothing is known about its ecology or biology. Researchers have sequenced the genome of W. sebiin order to understand its adaptations for surviving in osmotically challenging environments. Genomic data were also used to finally resolve the relationship of Wallemia which has helped to re-evaluate hypotheses about the evolution of basidiomycetes. Wallemia sebi has a compact genome (9.8 Mb), with few repeats and the largest fraction of genes with functional domains compared with other Basidiomycota. Despite the seemingly reduced genome, several gene family expansions and a high number of transporters were found that provide clues to the ability of W. sebi to colonize harsh environments. ; Matheny, PB, et al.
